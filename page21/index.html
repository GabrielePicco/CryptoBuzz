Bitcoin’s 161% year-to-date rally has been a significant driver for crypto firm share prices.  Bitcoin is trading at $43,964 at the time of writing, with a recent rally attributed to growing anticipation of a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-trade fund approval in January.

    "title": "Iranian woman beats government tyranny using Monero",
    "body": "2023/03/22 - (Original was athttps://www. reddit. com/r/Monero/comments/11w0mii/iranian_woman_beats_talibans_tyranny_using_monero/[https://www. reddit. com/r/Monero/comments/11w0mii/iranian_woman_beats_talibans_tyranny_using_monero/]but appears to have been deleted by reddit. Note from OP u/True-Description1674:The original title mentions “taliban” by mistake, the questions and answers fromthe woman are 100% real, they are referring to the way the Iranian governmenttreats its citizens. ) Hello everyone I bring you an anonymous interview from anIranian woman who wants to tell us a little about her perspective on cryptos andhow they have helped her in the midst of the growing tyranny in her country. ###1- Tell me about your socioeconomic context and how cryptos have helped you? Ihave not yet got the chance to spend my crypto, and to be honest, I have beenonly saving to build myself a new PC. The main reason is, in fact, living inIran, with the insane rate of inflation, it is nearly impossible for someonelike to be able to afford that, independently. Besides the food inflation(standing at the sixth place in the world), electronic devices and PC parts arealso priced based on the price of dollar. Meanwhile, we make money in rials–oneof the most worthless currencies in the world, right now and as it gets more andmore worthless every day, free-falling, and with a salary raise rate, that isnot enough at all or close to the rate of inflation. On the other side, dollaronly goes up (and unlike the famous saying goes, “what goes up must come down”,it has never fallen back to its previous value). So, you save and save and oneday you wake up to see the prices have doubled or tripled. I think, just knowingthat I own an amount of crypto has at the least helped me feel more financiallysecured, which is a relief. Knowing that sooner or later, I will reach my verybasic goal, even though I live in a third-world in the middle east. ### 2- Howdid you find out about cryptocurrencies? I had heard about cryptos and tokens,maybe five or six years ago as something I could earn by doing tasks likewatching ads—a way to make money during school Summer break, but that was it. Iwas a teen, fully caught up with art, with little to no interest in atechnology, that I could not touch. So of course, I did not bother to dig anymore about cryptos, until later, in 2020, when the NFT market started to blow upand I tried to read about it in more depth. In the beginning, it was quitecomplicated to understand all these terms, everything was totally new and fromanother whole planet for me. At this point, crypto was finally becoming moreentangled with my profession at least, attracting me towards it, especiallybecause I found the original notion and concept behind NFTs, prettypraiseworthy. I absolutely respected and admired the coming change, until thatalso got corrupted in my opinion, and people started paying absurd amounts ofmoney for shallow pieces like the famous apes, which makes no sense to me atall! So, here I stepped back and out of NFTs, while I was still learning aboutcryptos, indirectly and through the conversations, me and my partner had. Hespecifically taught me a lot about Monero—his favorite coin, and gradually,since last year, I got to know more people through him, who helped me so muchwith educating myself on cryptocurrencies and more importantly, the vitality ofprivacy! ### 3- How did you get your first cryptocurrency? I got my firstcryptocurrency through work. After an online collaboration I had as a freelanceartist and was paid in Monero. ### 4- How does it make you feel to befinancially independent in a context like yours? In one word: stronger. I feelmore confident and the earning makes me feel that my work is actually beingappreciated. Receiving Iranian rial in return for the work you do can sometimesfeel like being a slave, especially when I look at the majority of our society,the working class people and white-collar employees, that are employed by thegovernment/state. Wake up at dawn, run, bumping to people in the subway to geton that first train and arrive at your workplace on time, where you have to dosomething you do not even enjoy for minimum 7 hours, and only make 250 dollars amonth, that covers your food, bills and maybe your rent. Going on a vacationwill be a whim, and of course saving in rials is not even a rational thing todo. So, all of this makes me feel lucky and privileged, wishing that everybodysoon migrates from this worthless currency to a much more valuable one–a safeand private money, that does have some respect for your human dignity. Thesimplest incentive is that you would at least be able to “keep up” with theinflation, save yourself from getting unjustly poorer as the titanic is sinking,granting you some peace of mind. ### 5- What are the advantages anddisadvantages of cryptos? The most beautiful thing about cryptos in my opinion,the same as what the Internet did, is how the unnecessary gaps and walls made bythe governments got closed. No matter the geographical distance or what goes onpolitically between your country and mine, we can still interact with eachother. In crypto (especially with Monero), there is no PayPal-like games played,to freeze my account, block my transactions for using the word ‘Persian’ or‘Cuban’ in the note! On the other hand, I don’t see any disadvantages really, orat least not yet! Except for the fact that the idea behind cryptos could beabused and high jacked by the governments as we can see now, through theestablishment of CBDCs for instance. Believe it or not, Islamic Republic istrying to create a CBDC and the thought of it alone is like a nightmare. In sucha Nineteen Eighty-Four like dictatorship, with people that are unfortunately notreally educated on this matter, that is the one of the hugest threats topeople’s freedom and lives. However, in a society where the people are educatedand well-informed about cryptocurrencies, there would be nothing to worry about. Everyone must come to this conclusion, once and forever, that the system is notto be trusted, the majority of politicians, if not all of them, anywhere in theworld are corrupt in one way or another, and they only rarely work in people’sfavors. We need to separate our ways by not giving in so easily, not makingourselves dependent on them, letting them stab us in the back every once inwhile. ### 6- Do you consider cryptocurrencies to be some kind of anti-statemechanism? Absolutely. I believe cryptocurrencies, not the ones from the centralbanks of course, are an anti-state mechanism, or else the Islamic Republicwouldn’t have arrested those who were mining crypto, and the US wouldn’t havebeen looking forward to creating CBDC. ### 7- What is it like to have economicfreedom as a woman in Iran? It was a couple years ago, that I started to noticethings that I did not really paid attention to, when I was younger. I heard/readstories from women, I saw how much more fragile it makes you, when you cannotfinancially support yourself and stand on your own feet and be at least,partially independent. As a woman, I can see that we do need to have savings, nomatter the country you live in. But it definitely becomes much more of a seriousmatter, if you are a woman in a country like Iran with absolutely anti-womenlaws, written in accordance to the 1400-year-old sharia. Women and girls in Iranare treated as second class citizens, and I am confident, that 99 percent of thelaws are against women! I quote what the UN expert, Javaid Rehman has said in anarticle[https://www. ohchr. org/en/press-releases/2021/03/iran-women-and-girls-treated-second-class-citizens-reforms-urgently-needed]published on The United Nations Human Rights office’s website; “Blatantdiscrimination exists in Iranian law and practice that must change. In severalareas of their lives, including in marriage, divorce, employment, and culture,Iranian women are either restricted or need permission from their husbands orpaternal guardians, depriving them of their autonomy and human dignity. Theseconstructs are completely unacceptable and must be reformed now. ” That is thereason why economic freedom does matter even more in this part of the world. Inour culture, our grandmothers used to save in gold and hid them in pillows andmattresses, some could even buy themselves properties under their own names! Andthey were just simple house-wives with no income from the outside, except whatthe husbands provided them with. [link] www [dot] ohchr [dot]org/en/press-releases/2021/03/iran-women-and-girls-treated-second-class-citizens-reforms-urgently-needed 8- Has learning about cryptocurrencies made you see injustices in the: current financial system that you hadn’t noticed before? The Islamic Republicregime, as I mentioned earlier, detected and arrested those that were miningeither at home or on farms, made mining illegal, unless you have obtained thegovernment’s official authorization for mining. What they did after, wasconfiscating the farms and mining crypto for themselves. But that did notsurprise me much, as it is the Islamic Republic after all. But a year ago, Iwitnessed something, I did not really expect–an eye-opener for me to see theactual amount of authority banks have over our money and hate banks even more. The government had sent an amount of money as a welfare to the families thatstand under the poverty line, and then, froze the money for a month, whichtranslates to “do not use it, until I say so” with a pat on the back. I want tobank my own money! Another factor that makes cryptocurrencies and thistechnology a threat to the government, being an anti-state mechanism, is itspotential and ability to crush the banks. ### 9- What you think about privacy?In the past three months, I felt living in a literal “dystopia” with all of myentity, more than ever. There is an app, called Snapp (the Iranian Uber), with anonline food delivery service as well, has been exposing and giving outcostumers’ information to the government for them to find and arrest those thathave been actively participating in the protests. It’s so depressing to see howthey have successfully taken away our “safety” by taking away our privacy first,fooling us with their lies. It’s nothing surprising from such a crime-obsessedregime, but what’s scarier is to see it happen in other countries, too. We havealready thrown ourselves into their trap, but it is never too late. Privacy isvital and we need to protect it at all costs, protecting privacy is protectingourselves. For years and years they seeded an unnecessary fear in our hearts froma group of people in the society, the poor, those that turn to stealing andother crimes, while the real dangerous monsters are outside, free and in power!Then, utilized the same fear to take away our crucial right to privacy. Notmentioning the fact that those individuals, thieves, murderers, and so on, areall the products of the system’s corruption in one way or another. So, what doyou think? Highlights:  Iranian woman wants to tell us a little about her perspective on cryptos and how they have helped her in the midst of the growing tyranny in her country.  She had heard about cryptos about five or six years ago as something she could earn by doing tasks like watching ads.  She got her first cryptocurrency through work and was paid in Monero.  She says she feels more confident and the earning makes her feel that her work is actually being appreciated.

According to Mallers, inflation within the 5-10% range will now be normalized, meaning Bitcoin will appreciate against dollars as more of the latter enters circulation.  BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said the Fed’s new program will usher in “infinite money printing”"

Highlights:  Bitcoin evangelists are enjoying a huge rally in their favorite coin, which has soared more than 30% in the past seven days.  Many in the market believe crypto is rallying not because of fear triggered by the crisis itself, but rather the aggressive response from the government and Federal Reserve that has seen hundreds of billions of dollars added to, or pledged to, the banking system and dramatically shifted the outlook for interest rates.  The FUD short for fear, uncertainty and doubt that had long been targeted at crypto by traditional finance is running in the opposite direction now.  Yet the resurfacing of Bitcoin’s origin story has given true believers a “told ya so” moment, but it’s not necessarily what drove the coin’s price up. "
