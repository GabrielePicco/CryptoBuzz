Microstrategy's Michael Saylor is transitioning to executive chairman, and he's as \"enthusiastic as ever\" about bitcoin. That's even as the firm is underwater on its crypto holdings.

## Highlights

- Michael Saylor is stepping down as chief executive officer of Microstrategy to become executive chairman.
- Saylor said he will "focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives" Saylor first spearheaded the push to add bitcoin to the firm's balance sheet in August 2020.
- The firm's underlying business had a less-than-stellar quarter, even aside from the charges it took to write down the value of its bitcoin holdings.
- The market value of these holdings as reported with Tuesdayâ€™s earnings stood at $2.451 billion.
- That's even as the firm is underwater on its crypto holdings, with 39% of its shares sold short, meaning traders are betting they will fall.
