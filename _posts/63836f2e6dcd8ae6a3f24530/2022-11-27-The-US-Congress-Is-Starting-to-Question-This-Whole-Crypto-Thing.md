Think Washington lawmakers have what it takes to tackle the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? Neither do they.

## Highlights

- Congress is cool, calm, and collectively, well, daft in the US Capitol.
- Members of Congress seem to wrestle with the definition of what “money’s” is.
- US senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming) says the rise of cryptocurrencies—and the dangers that come with them—caught Congress by surprise.
- House Democratic leaders seem to be on the same (if antiquated) page.
- Despite the current crypto collapse, according to Hakeem Jeffries and many other powerful party leaders, there's time to kill, says Jeffries, House Democratic leader.
- Lummises wants to regulate the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, at the very least.
