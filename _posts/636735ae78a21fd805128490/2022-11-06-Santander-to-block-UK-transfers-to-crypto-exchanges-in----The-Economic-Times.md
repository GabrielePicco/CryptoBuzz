Faster Payments is the infrastructure which facilitates real-time bank transfers for most UK bank accounts. Pay UK, which owns Faster Payments, said in emailed comments that it was \"working with regulators and the payments industry to develop and implement better protection for victims of fraud.\"

## Highlights

- Santander will block UK customers from sending real-time payments to cryptocurrency exchanges next year.
- The move is part of measures to protect customers from scams, the bank said in an emailed statement.
- Santander has seen a "large increase" in UK customers becoming victims of cryptocurrency fraud in recent months.
- Regulators around the world have warned of the risks of scams and fraud in the largely unregulated world of crypto trading.
- Customers will face limits of 1,000 pounds ($1,123) per transaction and 3,000 dollars in total in any rolling 30-day period, for transfers to crypto exchanges via mobile and online banking, Santander said.
