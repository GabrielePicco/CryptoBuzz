Twitter’s soon-to-be owner says he wants to “authenticate” all humans, but did not say what that actually means.

## Highlights

- Musk has said he wants to make open source the algorithms that drive Twitter.
- Twitter’s soon-to-be owner says he wants all humans, but did not say what that actually means.
- “Open-source apps usually are easier to make bots for,” says someone I know.
- Musk has not committed to making the data that Twitter's algorithms use to drive their decision-making process public, but that's probably where the real digital gold lies.
