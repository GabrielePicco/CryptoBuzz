Cryptocurrencies fell to fresh lows on Monday on regulatory concerns and as investors globally turned shy on risky assets with interest rate rises looming around the world.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, fell about 5% to a three-month low of $18,387.
- Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, dropped 3% to $1,285 and is down more than 10% in the last 24 hours.
- Ether's value has fallen amid some speculation that remarks last week from U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler implied the new structure could attract extra regulation.
- "It's speculation as to what might or might not happen," said Matthew Dibb, COO of Singapore crypto platform Stack Funds, on the regulatory outlook.
- "A lot of the hype has come out of the markets since the Merge," he said.
