Gamers will be able to create their very own ramps — and place them in the metaverse to generate bespoke skating challenges.

## Highlights

- Gamers will be able to create their very own ramps — and place them in the metaverse to generate bespoke skating challenges.
- Tony Hawk has teamed up with The Sandbox for the project, which will span 36 plots of virtual land.
- The Tony Hawk Pro Skater franchise has generated more than $1.4 billion in revenue over the past 23 years.
- It'll also be possible to snap up new gear so your avatar looks good in the game's metaverse.
- Animoca Brands raised $75 million in a new funding round — attracting a valuation of $5.9 billion - and this major deal with Hawk could be a sign of things to come.
