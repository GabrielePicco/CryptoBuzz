As the headline-grabbing litigation between Ripple (XRP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moves forward, more information has come to the forefront.

## Highlights

- A recent document suggests that Ripple expects the lawsuit to end between August 26 and November 18, 2022.
- The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple and two of its executives in December 2020, due to the blockchain company allegedly selling over $1.3 billion in unregistered XRP between 2013 and 2020.
- Ripple believes it will win the SEC case in September or October, after which the class action will go away due to collateral estoppel – a doctrine preventing a party from relitigating an issue resolved in a previous lawsuit, even if the issue pertains to a different claim.
- RippleNet unequivocally abides by international law and the sanctions by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
