The collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange will cost investors billions. But why would anyone give money to a man who plays video games in important meetings?

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried launched a cryptocurrency exchange that got people excited about that sort of thing very excited indeed.
- All of the big players in venture capital, including Sequoia Capital, lined up to throw money at the kid.
- Instead of becoming the world’s first trillionaire, SBF saw his net worth plummet from $16.2bn to about $3 overnight.
- Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers has likened FTX's collapse to the Enron scandal, saying that from the reports, there were “whiffs of fraud” about it.
- The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, for example, invested $75m in FTX.
