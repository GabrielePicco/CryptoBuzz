Several experts have disagreed with the U.S. SEC’s claim that it has jurisdiction over Ethereum transactions because there are more ETH nodes …

## Highlights

- SEC claims jurisdiction over ETH transactions because there are more ETH nodes in the country than any other.
- Regulator argued that since these nodes “are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country,” the transactions happened in the U.S.
- The SEC’s jurisdiction claim sets a dangerous precedence for the crypto industry as assets whose nodes are densely clustered in the US could face this overreach in the future.
- According to Ethernodes data, roughly 43% of the network's nodes are located in the state of California, according to the data.
- The SEC's jurisdiction claim is a dangerous precedent for the industry.
