A market analyst, Conor Ryder, CFA, examined the liquidity of the cryptocurrency markets. The liquidity issue was brought to light by market depth, spreads, slippage, and volume. Recent problems in the banking industry have only exacerbated

## Highlights

- A market analyst, Conor Ryder, CFA, examined the liquidity of the cryptocurrency markets.
- The liquidity issue was brought to light by market depth, spreads, slippage, and volume.
- According to the analyst, the current high volatility in cryptocurrency markets is primarily due to low liquidity.
- The liquid flow gap following the implosion of FTX is one of the factors contributing to the current lack of liquidity in the markets.
- Binance recently announced the end of the zero-fee program for all BTC trading pairs, with the exception of BTC/TUSD.
- The good news is that liquidity appears to have returned to levels seen in early March, although the loss of easy fiat on-ramps may have a longer-term effect.
