The NFT industry is still “in its infancy” with many exciting developments to come, Kraken Australia’s managing director tells Cointelegraph.

## Highlights

- Nonfungible token (NFT) trading volumes have dropped nearly 98% since January.
- Several industry executives tell Cointelegraph that it’s nothing to fear as the technology continues to develop and mature.
- The NFT industry is still “in its infancy” with many exciting developments to come, one of them says.
- The biggest barrier to mass adoption is “nightmare user experiences,” a Kraken executive says.
- NFT gaming platform Balthazar DAO founder John Stefanidis says the trading downfall is not significant in the grand scheme of NFTs as people need to understand that “NFTs are more than just photos”
