title:  "If you got 250 ETH lying around you can own a Russian Tank. (Pickup only)"
description: "Each of my tank is ethically sourced, that means they were abandoned, no crew was hurt in the process.
So the insides are clean, most if not all of the equipment has been left inside, and they are not haunted.

ALL earning go directly into restarting our agriculture after the war is over. Russian army has damaged a lot of expensive farming equipment in our community, which is necessary to supply Ukrainian homes with our homegrown crops.

Every NFT comes with secret tags that only the owner can see, which contain the exact coordinates where the tank is hidden, along with the exact retrieval instructions. More information can be found on individual listings for each tank. YES, you have to transport it away yourself. In Europe you can move it by train, but if you are dedicated, it can probably be shipped to USA or anywhere else by cargoship.

Right now getting my family out of the conflict zone safely is number 1 priority, so these 3 are, and will be the only tanks in this collection!"
