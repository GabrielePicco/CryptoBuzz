A total of $27 million was funneled into the company without the newsroom's knowledge.

## Highlights

- The Block was founded in 2018 and CEO Michael McCaffrey led a buyout of the company's investors in April 2021, making it 100% owned by employees.
- Sources say money funneled to The Block's CEO from the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency trading firm, Alameda Research, went to finance the purchase of an apartment in the Bahamas for him.
- The newsroom was informed of the payments in an all-hands meeting early Friday afternoon.
- The company had previously raised over $4 million across convertible notes from venture firms, including Greycroft, Pantera, BlockTower Capital, and Bloomberg Beta, Axios' Kia Kokalitcheva reported.
