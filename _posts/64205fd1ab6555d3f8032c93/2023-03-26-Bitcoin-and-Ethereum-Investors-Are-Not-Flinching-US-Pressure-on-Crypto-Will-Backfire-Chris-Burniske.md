A venture capitalist who correctly called the 2022 crypto bottom says investors of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and the broader digital asset market are not batting an eye over the US government's latest enforcement actions against key players in the industry.

## Highlights

- A venture capitalist who correctly called the 2022 crypto bottom says investors in Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader digital asset market are not batting an eye over the US government’s latest enforcement actions against key players in the industry.
- According to the Placeholder partner, the regulatory pressure on the industry will ultimately strengthen the conviction of crypto investors and pull in more people into Bitcoin.
- In fact, as we’ve seen since the SVB [Silicon Valley Bank] collapse, they’re shifting even more into Bitcoin.
- So this is where I think you’ll see the strategy from the government ultimately backfire,” says Chris Burniske.
