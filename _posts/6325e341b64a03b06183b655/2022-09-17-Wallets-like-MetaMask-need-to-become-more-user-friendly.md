Most wallets feel like they were created for developers. That’s becoming a bigger problem in terms of both practicality and security as crypto adoption increases.

## Highlights

- After the Merge, it’s an ideal time to think about how we can improve smart contracts.
- To fully trust a smart contract, a consumer needs to know exactly what it's going to do when they make a transaction.
- Unlike in the Web2 world, there's no customer support hotline to call and recover funds if something goes wrong.
- Smart contracts can be created by developers without asking anybody for permission, but that can also expose users to considerable risk.
- Many incidents where users lose their crypto assets are caused by buggy or malicious smart contracts, writes Mark Hammond.
- Hammond: Consumers are often pressured to act quickly when interacting with smart contracts when they interact with them.
