\"As the evidence against SBF becomes clearer, the former FTX CEO might lean towards pleading to take life in prison off the table,\" writes Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried is facing criminal charges related to multi-billion dollar fraud at FTX.
- Federal sentencing guidelines recommend life in prison for him.
- Prosecutors sometimes take a victim-centered approach, which focuses on making victims whole.
- The only way to annul the sentencing guidelines would be to plead guilty and cooperate with the government.
- A downward departure from the federal sentencing guidelines will likely mean a judge will likely ask for the judge to depart from those guidelines based on a downward departure based on the judge's discretion.
- Prosecutors will need to strike a fair balance, especially if they plead guilty, writes Andrew Hammond.
