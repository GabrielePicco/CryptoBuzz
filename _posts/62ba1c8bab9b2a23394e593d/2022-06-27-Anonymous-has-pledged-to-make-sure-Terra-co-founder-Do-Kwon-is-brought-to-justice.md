Anonymous has highlighted a laundry list of Do Kwon’s wrongdoings in relation to Terra's collapse and has vowed to bring his various “crimes” to light.

## Highlights

- Hacktivist group Anonymous has pledged to “make sure” Terra co-founder Do Kwon is “brought to justice as soon as possible” in regard to the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) ecosystems in May.
- A video purportedly coming from the Anonymous hacker group rehashes a laundry list of Kwon’s alleged wrongdoings, including cashing out $80 million each month from LUNA and UST prior to its collapse, as well as his role in the fall of stable coin Basis Cash.
- The video has around 3.4 million views as of Monday.
