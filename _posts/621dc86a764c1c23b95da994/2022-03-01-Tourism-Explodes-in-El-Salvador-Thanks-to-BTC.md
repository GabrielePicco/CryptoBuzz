The country of El Salvador says it is experiencing a lot more tourism ever since it made bitcoin legal tender.

## Highlights

- El Salvador announced last year that it was going to make bitcoin legal tender.
- The country is experiencing a huge boom in tourism thanks to its newfound love of crypto.
- The tourism sector increased in November and December more than 30 percent.
- The goal of the nation when it first adopted bitcoin was to ensure it was no longer dependent on any other country or currency.
- El Salvadorâ€™s bitcoin journey, while ultimately successful, has not always been easy for its government or its people.
- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) practically begged El Salvador to turn away from bitcoin forever and reject cryptocurrency.
