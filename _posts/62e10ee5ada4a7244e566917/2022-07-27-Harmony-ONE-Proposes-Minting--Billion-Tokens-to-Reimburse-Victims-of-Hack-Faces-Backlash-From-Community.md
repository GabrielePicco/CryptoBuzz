In an effort to reimburse victims of the Horizon Bridge hack in June, the Harmony team has proposed minting several billion more ONE tokens to disperse to victims over a three-year period.

## Highlights

- The team behind the Harmony blockchain project has proposed the minting of up to 4.97 billion worth of its native token ONE to compensate victims of the $100 million Horizon Bridge hack in June.
- The proposal has been met with a significant amount of backlash from members of the community, with many highlighting concerns that such a large issuance of new tokens would result in inflationary pressure on the asset and bring its value down.
- The team is awaiting community feedback before proceeding forward, but initial responses already appear to be overwhelmingly negative, with most comments on the community page or on Twitter voicing strong concerns with the ideas.
- In June, the Horizon Bridge to the Harmony layer-1 blockchain was exploited for $100
