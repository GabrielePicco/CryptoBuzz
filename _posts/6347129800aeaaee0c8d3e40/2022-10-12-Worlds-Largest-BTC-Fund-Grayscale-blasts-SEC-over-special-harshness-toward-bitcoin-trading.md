Crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments LLC, which manages the world’s largest bitcoin investment fund, told a federal appeals court on Tuesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is so suspicious of bitcoin spot trading that it blocked a proposal to make it easier and safer for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.

## Highlights

- Grayscale Investments says SEC is so suspicious of bitcoin spot trading that it blocked a proposal to make it easier and safer for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.
- The SEC rejected a proposal from the New York Stock Exchange to convert a $15 billion bitcoin investment trust into an exchange-traded fund, despite the SEC’s previous approval of funds based on bitcoin futures.
- The fund is based on an index of spot, or instantaneous, bitcoin trading prices, rather than bitcoin futures contracts.
- The NYSE had pointed out that it shares information with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but the SEC said it was not convinced that the CME bitcoin futures market qualified as a “market of significant size” for spot bitcoin trading
