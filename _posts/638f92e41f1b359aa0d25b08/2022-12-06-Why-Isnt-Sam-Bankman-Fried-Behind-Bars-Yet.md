Lots of people are asking why ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried isn't behind bars. Legal experts explain here the reasons.

## Highlights

- Ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is still in the spotlight, but not for the right reasons.
- The disgraced founder and former boss of the collapsed crypto exchange owes $3.1 billion just to its top 50 creditors.
- Legal experts say we still don’t know whether anything criminal took place.
- While an SBF charge is just a matter of time, investigations for prosecution often take time.
- FTX was not your typical company, and the world of crypto is rarely simple.
- The Bahamas has an extradition treaty with the U.S., should it come to that, it will be some time before anyone is behind bars.
