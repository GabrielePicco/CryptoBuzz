Much of the information regarding the shocking events around FTX turns out to be quite different than expected.

## Highlights

- FTX Digital Markets Ltd.
- filed for bankruptcy after Binance backed off from a potential acquisition deal in the middle of the month.
- A day later, reports started coming up that some of the SBF-founded exchangeâ€™s wallets were being drained, and the total amount neared $500 million.
- Some speculated that this could be an inside job and warned that Bankman-Fried, who had stepped down as CEO recently, was trying to flee with the money.
- However, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas took it to Twitter to shed some more light on the events.
- The watchdog said its move was in line with its intentions to protect customers and creditors of the fallen exchange.
