- Some people are still of the opinion that the system would encourage fraudulence during the election, hence the need for blockchain technology to prevent tampering or modification of electronic voting results.
- The public patent application that contains 47 pages is majorly occupied with diagrams showing various components of the proposed system, coupled with each stage of the electronic process.
