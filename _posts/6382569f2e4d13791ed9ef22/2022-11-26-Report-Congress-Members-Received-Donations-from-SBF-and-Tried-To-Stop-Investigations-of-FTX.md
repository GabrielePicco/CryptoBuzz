Report: Congress Members Received Donations from ‘Crypto Maddoff’ and Tried To Stop Investigations of FTX

## Highlights

- A report accuses Congress members of trying to stop government investigations into FTX because they received donations from employees of the crypto exchange.
- The American Prospect said the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to obtain information about the collapsed company earlier this year.
- The group, dubbed the “Blockchain Eight” by the Prospect, was made up of four Democrats and four Republicans, including newly-elected Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a tech and innovation enthusiast.
- Five of the eight members received campaign donations from FTX employees, ranging from $2,900 to $11,600, the report says.
- The SEC declined to comment and six of the representatives have not responded to the Prospect’s requests.
