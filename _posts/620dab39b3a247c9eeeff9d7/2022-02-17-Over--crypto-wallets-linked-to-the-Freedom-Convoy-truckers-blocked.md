Over 30 Crypto Wallets linked to 'Freedom Convoy' Truckers Blocked. They had been collecting Bitcoin for the Freedom Convoy 2022 campaign.

## Highlights

- 34 cryptocurrency wallets purportedly linked to Canadian truckers protesting COVID-19 limitations and soliciting funds for the Freedom Convoy 2022 campaign with Bitcoin have been frozen.
- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s invoked the emergency act.
- Canadian police department has issued an order forcing all FINTRAC-regulated firms in Canada to avoid engaging with 34 crypto wallets.
- At least one wallet containing more than $1 million in Bitcoin has been validated as part of the HonkHonkHodl initiative to support truckers via cryptocurrency, which became one of the most important ways to help truckers when GoFundMe decided not to disperse $9 million collected on its site.
