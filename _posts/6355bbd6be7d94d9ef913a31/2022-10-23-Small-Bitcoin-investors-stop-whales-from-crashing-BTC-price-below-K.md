Bitcoin price has avoided a bigger plunge below $18,000 in recent months, raising expectations that a market bottom may have been forming.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price has avoided a bigger plunge below $18,000 in recent months, raising expectations that a market bottom may have been formed.
- Bitcoin's 40-day correlation with riskier markets, such as Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, has been flattening near 0.69 and 0.75, respectively.
- On the other hand, its correlation with gold has surged from zero in August to 0.67 in October.
- Fishes have been accumulating BTC during the coinâ€™s sideways trend, data provided by Glassnode shows.
- The trend is similar across the entities holding anything between 0.001 and 10 BTC.
- However, the downside risk is historically greater with a decreasing whale population, as shown below.
