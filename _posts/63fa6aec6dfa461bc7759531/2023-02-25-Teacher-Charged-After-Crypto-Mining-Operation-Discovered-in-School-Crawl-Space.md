A judge issued an arrest warrant for a teacher charged with illegal crypto mining at a Massachusetts school.

## Highlights

- Nadeam Nahas, 39, was teaching at Cohasset High School in Massachusetts when a town facilities inspector found an unusual electrical setup in one room.
- Police were alerted by the town’s IT director and requested the assistance of the U.S.
- Coast Guard Investigative Service and the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the crawl space under the school.
- Nahas resigned from his position in early 2022 and a criminal complaint was issued for fraudulent use of electricity and school vandalization.
- He was scheduled to appear in Quincy District court for his arraignment on Thursday, but he never showed, forcing the court judge to issue a warrant for Nahas’ arrest.
