Coinbase, the crypto exchange operator, was granted a key license in Singapore.

## Highlights

- The Monetary Authority of Singapore handed the company a Major Payment Institution license.
- The licence paves the way for the company to offer a wider range of Digital Payment Token services to both retail and institutional customers in the region.
- The U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company in June for allegedly operating as an unregistered broker and exchange in violation of federal securities laws.
- Singapore is viewed as relatively crypto-friendly, but its stance towards the industry has been tested over the past year by crises at multiple crypto outfits with Singapore links.
- Wallet firms Crypto.com and Blockchain.com both scored MPI licenses over the summer.
