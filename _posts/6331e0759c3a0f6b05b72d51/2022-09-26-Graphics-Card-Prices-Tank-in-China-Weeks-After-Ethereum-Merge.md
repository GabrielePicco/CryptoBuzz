Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake has further impacted graphics card markets since they can no longer be used to mine the asset.

## Highlights

- Graphics card vendors in China have reported reeling prices for mid and high-end units over the past two months.
- When ETH could be mined, and the bull market was in full swing, demand for Nvidia’s flagship GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 models saw recommended retail prices tripling.
- However, according to merchants in Shanghai's electronics retail market, demand and prices have slumped almost 40% over past three months.
- There is also a thriving second-hand market for graphics cards but gamers remain reluctant to buy a card that has been used for crypto mining as they run close to full capacity 24 hours a day which stresses the components.
- Supply chain disruptions have resulted in prices remaining elevated in the west where graphics cards are still in high demand
