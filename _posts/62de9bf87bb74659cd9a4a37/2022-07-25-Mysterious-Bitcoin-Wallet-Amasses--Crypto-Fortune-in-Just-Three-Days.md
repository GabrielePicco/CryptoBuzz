A new Bitcoin wallet has amassed a massive crypto fortune after collecting more than $3 billion worth of BTC in less than one week.

## Highlights

- A new Bitcoin wallet has amassed a massive crypto fortune after collecting more than $3 billion worth of BTC in less than one week.
- The wallet, which was created on June 15th, picked up 15,499 BTC for a total of $345.9 million on July 19th.
- The next day, the deep-pocketed investor ramped up the Bitcoin transfers to the tune of 45,499.
