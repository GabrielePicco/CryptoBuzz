\"I've never seen a change happen this quickly,\" one recruiter said as many make the jump from Meta and Google to join crypto and Web3 endeavors.

## Highlights

- Executives and developers alike are jumping ship from Google, Meta, Amazon, and others.
- They're making the leap in part to cash in early on what they view as the future of the industry, recruiters said.
- Experts agreed that as executives jump into those spaces, "the rest will follow," experts said.
- The move is similar to what happened when on-demand companies like Uber and Lyft became popular in the early 2010s, one recruiter said.
- "I've never seen a change happen this quickly," another expert said of the current trend.
