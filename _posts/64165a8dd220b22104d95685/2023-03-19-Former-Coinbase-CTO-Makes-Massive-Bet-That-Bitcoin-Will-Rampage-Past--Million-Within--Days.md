Balaji Srinivasan, the former CTO of Coinbase and a former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has agreed to a rather large

## Highlights

- Former CTO of Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz general partner Balaji Srinivasan has made a public wager on the price performance of BTC.
- Self-proclaimed social democrat James Medlock initiated the bet on Friday by making a public offer to bet anyone $1 million that the United States does not go into hyperinflation.
- American professional poker player Isaac Haxton decided to send 1 BTC to the escrow on behalf of Medlock, noting that heâ€™ll take all the downside if he loses and none of the upside if the social democrat wins as long as he pledges to donate 70% to GiveDirectly.
- BTC is changing hands at $27,200.34 as of press time, up roughly 36% over the past seven days
