Bitcoin returns to 2013 in terms of price/address ratio as BTC price downside makes a \"compelling\" case.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) has not been this good value since it cost $1,130, one analyst argues as BTC offers a “compelling” risk/reward ratio.
- Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at asset manager Fidelity Investments, described $20,000 Bitcoin as “cheap’s cheap.
- BTC/USD is now back at where it was at the peak of the 2013 bull market, according to Timmer.
- Bitcoin adoption still reflects the rise of the internet, and the Bitcoin network “appears to be intact” when it comes to its growth cycles, Timmer said.
