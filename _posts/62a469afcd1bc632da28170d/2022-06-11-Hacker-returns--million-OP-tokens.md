The Optimism hacker has fulfilled a promise to return the coins but only transferred 17 million out of the 18 million OP tokens in their wallet.

## Highlights

- Optimism hacker has returned 17 million of 20 million Optimism (OP) tokens stolen from market maker Wintermute.
- One million OP tokens remain with the hacker as of press time.
- Attacker made good on promise to return the funds, albeit 3 million tokens short.
- Hacker was able to access funds because Wintermut provided an undeployed multi-signature wallet to Optimism to receive a 20 million OP token grant from the latter.
- The attacker previously sent 1 million coins to Vitalik Buterin and also sold another 1 million immediately following the hack.
- The exploiter still has 1 million of the coins left in the wallet as of the time of publishing.
