Cloudflare is going to participate in the research and development of the core infrastructure that helps keep Ethereum secure, fast, as well as energy efficient for everyone.

## Highlights

- Cloudflare will launch experiments for the next generation of web3 networks that are embracing Proof of Stake consensus mechanisms.
- This is a next-generation consensus protocol to secure blockchains that relies on complex cryptographic functions to create consensus and prevent attacks.
- The last two years changed the web3 use landscape.
- Traffic to the Bitcoin and the Bitcoin networks has exploded.
- Technologies like Smart Contracts that power DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have started to become commonplace in the developer community (and in the Twitter lexicon).
- The next generation.
