WASHINGTON - The Internal Revenue Service plans to hire 10,000 employees in a push to cut...

## Highlights

- The IRS will accelerate recruiting in the coming weeks for 80 distinct positions, from entry-level clerical workers to advanced engineers and tax attorneys.
- The number of new jobs would represent a 14% increase in the IRS workforce.
- The IRS entered the tax season this year with 24 million unprocessed paper returns and correspondence, almost all dating back to the 2020 filing season.
- The agency plans to use money from its existing budget, a large share of it from coronavirus stimulus funding, to pay for the new hires.
- It remains unclear how much the agency will spend on the hiring plan, but it will be significantly smaller than Biden's proposed IRS investment of $80 billion over the next decade.
