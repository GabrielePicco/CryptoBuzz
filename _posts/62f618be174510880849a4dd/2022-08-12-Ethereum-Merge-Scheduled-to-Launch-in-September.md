Ethereum is scheduled to ship the Merge between September 15 and 16. The network completed its final Merge test run earlier today.

## Highlights

- The number one smart contract network completed its final test run for the update on the Goerli testnet today.
- Developers have slated a September 15 to 16 target date for the network to complete "the Merge" to Proof-of-Stake.
- The upgrade is expected to bring several benefits, including a 99.9% reduction in energy consumption and a 90% ETH issuance cut since the protocol will no longer need to pay miners to add new blocks to the chain (theyâ€™ll be added by validators staking their ETH instead).
- The most anticipated crypto event of the year has a tentative launch date, though the date could theoretically change should any issues arise.
