With this bridge, Flare intends to enable secure and trustless interoperability between Algorand and Bitcoin, as well as other non-DeFi assets.

## Highlights

- Flare network announced that it had been awarded a 7-figure Algorand Foundation SupaGrant to develop a Bitcoin bridge into the DeFi ecosystem.
- Flare will also add Bitcoin as a F asset, which can be leveraged to build dapps on Flare.
- The reason behind this bridge is the constant threat that looms over the DeF chains of being hacked.
- As it is just this year, two major crypto hacks left the investors with billions of dollars of their money stolen.
- While the bridge might open up new roads for the chain, its primary function as an investment vehicle isnâ€™t doing that well at the moment.
- After falling consistently throughout the months, ALGO is now trading at $0.66 at a 14-month low
