The Only Crypto Drama News Site

## Highlights

- Solana, a cryptocurrency in the top 10, recently shut down for a 7-hour period on Saturday after bots spammed the network with "Candy Machine" NFT microtransactions.
- This is not the first time the network has experienced this fate, like in September, when their team admitted that a denial of service attack (DOS) halted the network.
- The Solana team seems to be prioritizing transactions per second as opposed to network decentralization.
- The undeniable point of a blockchain is to have a secure and reliable way to send money to other people without a trusted third party.
- Nation states and other top projects will not build on Solana if the network is constantly congested and shutting down.
