## Highlights

- Bitcoin, the largest digital currency, fell as much as 8% to $36,639, the biggest intraday drop since April 11.
- The Nasdaq 100 was on track for one of its sharpest U-turns ever, wiping out its post-Fed gains.
- The Fed’s aggressive shift to raise interest rates has stock traders worrying about whether the central bank can slow the economy enough to halt high inflation but not so much as to cause a downturn.
