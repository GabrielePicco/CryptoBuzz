\"You can't flip a switch overnight, and run a G-20 economy on cryptocurrency,\" Michael Mosier, a deputy director at FinCEN, told a Senate committee.

## Highlights

- The US Treasury warned in October that decentralized digital assets could provide a workaround for sanctions imposed over Ukraine.
- There's no sign Russia or Putin are using cryptocurrencies to dodge sanctions, industry experts told US lawmakers.
- The crypto market is too small for economies as large as Russia to carry out widescale evasion via digital assets, experts told the Senate Banking Committee.
- Sanctions imposed by the US and its allies mean that major Russian banks have no access to the international SWIFT payments system, and the country is effectively cut off from the global financial system.
- A high risk of detection and seizure are factors that could discourage Russians from using crypto to sidestep sanctions, experts said.
