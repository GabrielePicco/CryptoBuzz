The FTX founder signs another remarkable deal.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Bankman-Fried fails to appear in court and will lose his bail bond if he does not appear.
- There is a second way to acquire a bail bond - someone can pledge collateral in the full amount of the bond.
- Then, if the defendant fails in court, the pledged collateral is forfeit to the court.
- So, in Bankman's case, that would mean he would need a benefactor to step up and pledge property worth $250 million to get the bond - but that did not happen either.
