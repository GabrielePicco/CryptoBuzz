Disgraced crypto executive Sam Bankman-Fried has made “recent attempts” to contact prospective witnesses in his criminal case, federal prosecutors said Friday.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried has made “recent attempts” to contact prospective witnesses in his criminal case, prosecutors said Friday.
- He has been free on a $250 million bond after he was charged with fraud and conspiracy following the collapse of the crypto platform he founded, FTX.
- Prosecutors asked the judge to modify the conditions of the bond and order him not to contact or communicate with current or former FTX or Alameda employees and not to use any encrypted messaging apps.
- Prosecutors said they were concerned the message proposed an alliance and suggested an effort to influence the general counsel’s potential testimony.
- There was no immediate response from the defense or the judge.
