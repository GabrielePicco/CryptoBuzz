Do Kwon has reportedly been added to Interpol's red notice list, raising questions of the consequences that await him and crypto as a whole.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon has been added to Interpol's red notice list, Korean prosecutors have said.
- Prosecutors want to speak to Kwon and five other associates for alleged violation of capital markets law, but the full details of their case remain unclear.
- Authorities worldwide have been investigating Kwon since Terra’s UST stablecoin lost its parity to the dollar in May in a $40 billion wipeout event that rocked an already-shaky cryptocurrency market.
- It's unclear how the prosecutors plan to present their case against Kwon, and to what extent he's fallen foul of the law.
- Kwon took to Twitter to tell his followers that he was “not ‘on the run,’” a claim that South Korean officials later refuted.
