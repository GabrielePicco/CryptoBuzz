After enforcing some amendments, El Salvador's Supreme Court allowed Nayib Bukele to run for a President for second time.

## Highlights

- The current President of El Salvador said he will compete in the next presidential elections in 2024.
- Nayib Bukele won 53% of the votes in the 2019 election.
- His decision comes despite the nation’s constitution that prohibits Presidents from having consecutive terms.
- The U.S.
- credit rating agency Fitch Ratings downgraded El Salvador's Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating to “CC” from “CCC” The agency said the move resulted from the country's “strained liquidity position” and troubled economy.
- It is yet to be seen whether the cryptocurrency revolution in El Salvador will continue after 2024.
