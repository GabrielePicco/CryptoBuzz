A Bank of America study found that 75% of wealthy millennials surveyed don't think they can achieve high returns from investments like stocks.

## Highlights

- Bank of America study found 75% of wealthy millennials are still investing in crypto.
- 75% said it's no longer possible to achieve above-average returns in traditional investments like stocks and index funds.
- Over half of young investors get crypto advice from social media platforms, like TikTok, Instagram, or Reddit.
- Financial experts recommend that crypto investors balance their riskier bets with safer, more traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds, and say crypto should make up a very small portion of your portfolio, ideally less than 5%.
- Young investors allocate 15% of their cash to cryptocurrencies, while those aged 43 and up said they only invest 2%.
