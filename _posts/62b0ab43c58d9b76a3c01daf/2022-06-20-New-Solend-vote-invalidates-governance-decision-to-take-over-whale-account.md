A new governance vote has passed that invalidates yesterday's move, with 99% of the votes supporting the new decision.

## Highlights

- Solend, a lending and borrowing protocol on Solana, has reversed yesterday's controversial decision to take control of its largest user account.
- A new governance vote has passed that invalidates yesterday's move, with 99% of the votes supporting the new decision.
- The issue was that an unknown user held a $108 million stablecoin loan collateralized by 5.7 million Solana (SOL) tokens ($170 million) on Solend.
- The team suggested that rather than a protocol liquidation, the loan should be wound up via an over-counter (OTC) deal.
- Later on social media, the governance decision received a lot of criticism from commentators who berated the team for undermining the ethos of decentralization.
