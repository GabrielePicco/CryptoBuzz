Crypto's most vocal critics also happen to be the biggest winners of the legacy financial system.

## Highlights

- Some of the world’s most powerful businessmen have been calling for a ban on crypto.
- Peter Bergen says the loudest critics of the new asset class all seem to have one thing in common–they’re some of the biggest winners of the legacy financial system.
- Bergen: There are scams and collapses in every industry, particularly early on, but no reasonable person ever proposes banning them.
- The opposition to crypto shouldn’t be taken seriously, says Bergen.
- The Bitcoin system has never been down or needed a bailout, he says.
- If anything, the opposition proves the kids are something over-the-top kids are over-top, he writes.
