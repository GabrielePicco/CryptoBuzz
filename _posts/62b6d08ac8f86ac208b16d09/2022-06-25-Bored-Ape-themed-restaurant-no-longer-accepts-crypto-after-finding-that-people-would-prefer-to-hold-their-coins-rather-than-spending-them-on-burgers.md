- The burger joint initially accepted the currencies but has since stopped accepting them.
- A staffer told The Times the payments were unwieldy and going largely ignored by customers at the restaurantâ€™s grand opening.
- Both ethereum and apecoin are down about 23% and 17% of their entire value over the last year over their last year's highs, estimates put themselves at the bottom of the crypto-crumity market.
- The restaurant's owner says he paid more than $330,000 for the different ape-themed NFTs that form the basis of his restaurant's brand.
