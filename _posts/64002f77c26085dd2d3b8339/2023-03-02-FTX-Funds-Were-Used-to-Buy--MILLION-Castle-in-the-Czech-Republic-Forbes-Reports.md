The castle is reportedly called Chateau Hostacov, and it was snapped up by a non-profit called the European Summer Program on Rationality, or ESPR for short.

## Highlights

- FTX Funds Were Used to Buy $3.5 MILLION Castle in the Czech Republic, Forbes Reports.
- The castle is reportedly called Chateau Hostacov, and it was snapped up by a non-profit called the European Summer Program on Rationality.
- The bigger question now is whether the ESPR will come under pressure to sell the castle and return funds to FTX's new management, who are attempting to claw back what is owed to millions of customers.
- John Ray, who is spearheading bankruptcy proceedings, has previously warned politicians and other organizations who received contributions from FTX that funds must be repaid in full â€” or they run the risk of facing court action and paying interest.
