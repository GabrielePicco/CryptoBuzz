The team behind Solana Spaces is shifting away from relying on brick-and-mortar gateways to onboard newcomers into Web3.

## Highlights

- Solana Spaces announced the closure of its company-owned and operated stores in New York and Miami.
- The company is shifting its focus away from relying on brick-mortar storefronts.
- Founder Vibhu Norby says the focus now is on the DRiP, an online platform that the company says saw the same amount of traffic as the physical stores.
- Norby: “I think the reality is that we could have kept them running, but it didn't make as much sense as it did in the past to do that, and so we didn’t,” Norby said in an interview with Decrypt.
