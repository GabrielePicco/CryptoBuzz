Backers of the idea argue that storing one-of-a-kind government documents on a digital ledger — in a similar manner to NFTs — would cut down on administrative costs and fraud.

## Highlights

- New York City Mayor Eric Adams said using the "blockchain" to store government documents is “the way of the future and we’re excited about it,” Adams told a room full of cryptocurrency investors on Monday.
- Backers of the idea argue that storing one-of-a-kind government documents on a digital ledger — in a similar manner to NFTs — would cut down on administrative costs and fraud.
- Adams famously converted his first three mayoral paychecks into bitcoin and ethereum this January and February in an effort to one-up the mayor of Miami.
- Adams reassured jittery crypto fanatics that “Fintech, blockchain, crypto is here to stay.”
