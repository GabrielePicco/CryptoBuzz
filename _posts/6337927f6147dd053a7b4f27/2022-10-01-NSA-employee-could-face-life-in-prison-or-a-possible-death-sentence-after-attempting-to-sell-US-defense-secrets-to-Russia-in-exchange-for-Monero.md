Jareh Sebastian Dalke could also be looking at life in prison if he's found guilty of trying to sell top secret US files to Russian agents.

## Highlights

- Jareh Sebastian Dalke allegedly tried to sell three classified US defense secrets to Russia in exchange for crypto.
- The 30-year-old former NSA employee was arrested earlier this week after an affidavit was filed by the FBI.
- The files in question relate to sensitive US defense capabilities, plans to update a certain cryptographic program, and assessments of foreign government military strength.
- In exchange for the secret files, Dalke is said to have asked for payment in crypto and at one point requested $85,000 worth of digital currency.Unfortunately for Dalke, the ‘foreign agent’ he was conspiring with turned out to be an undercover FBI operative, and he was arrested.
