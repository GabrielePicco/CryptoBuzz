Love, Death + Robots, an animated Netflix show, has just found a new way to interact with its audience through NFTs.

## Highlights

- Animated Netflix show uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to interact with its audience.
- There are nine QR codes embedded across the show's social media accounts as well as episodes.
- Watchers can use their phones to scan the QR code for access to an NFT which will appear on their OpenSea accounts.
- The feature is only available to US users through a MetaMask wallet or Coinbase account.
- Netflix reported a 200,000 loss of paid subscribers in its first quarter earnings this year, which followed by laying off 150 people from the company's editorial and social media teams.
- It's unclear what Netflix's long-term plans are for moving into the crypto, web3 and blockchain space.
