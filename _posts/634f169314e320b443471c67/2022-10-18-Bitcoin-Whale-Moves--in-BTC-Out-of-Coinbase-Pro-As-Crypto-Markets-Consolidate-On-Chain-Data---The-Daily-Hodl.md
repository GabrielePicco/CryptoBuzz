Nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) has been spotted suddenly leaving crypto exchange Coinbase as the flagship cryptocurrency trades 72% down from its all time high.

## Highlights

- 48,000 BTC with a dollar value of $940,032,000 left the Coinbase Pro platform early on Tuesday.
- Bitcoin is trading 72% down from its all time high.
- At time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands for $19,309, trading nearly flat for more than six weeks.
- After the big transfer, 8,000 coins were deposited onto the exchange, split up into batches of 122 coins each.
- The firm teases the idea that institutions could be behind the whale transfer, and that it could be a clean outflow to cold storage by a large player.
- The Daily Hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets nor is an investment advisor.
