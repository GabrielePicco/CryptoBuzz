Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., is working on the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which she described as a “bill to fully integrate digital assets.”

## Highlights

- Sen.
- Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., is working with colleagues and crypto industry advocates to put “the final touches” on a new bill.
- The Responsible Financial Innovation Act aims to provide clarity to the digital asset industry and retail cryptocurrency users.
- Currently, the law views any gain from the sale of a cryptocurrency as a taxable event, which doesn’t sound particularly unreasonable.
- At present that means any gain, no matter how small, is capital gains tax as it applies to cryptocurrencies.
- The biggest issue, by far, is applying an exclusion for small sales, the senator is currently looking at $600, his state policy director said.
