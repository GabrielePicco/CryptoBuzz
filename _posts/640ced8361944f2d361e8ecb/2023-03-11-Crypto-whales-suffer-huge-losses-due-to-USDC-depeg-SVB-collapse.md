Projects, stakeholders and protocols have all reported severe losses.

## Highlights

- USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin depegging caused by collapse of its counterparty Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crypto whales have reported severe losses and appear to have embarked on a series of capital flights to protect assets.
- At the time of publication, the price of USDC has fallen 8.30% in the past 24 hours to $0.9163.
- MakerDAO, the stablecoinâ€™s issuer, filed an emergency protocol on March 11 that, among many items, called for restrictions on minting DAI using USDC.
- The same day, Tron founder Justin Sun reportedly withdrew 82 million USDC from the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Aave v2, and swapped from Dai (DAI).
