Citing earlier data showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration in late 2022, Powell warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.

## Highlights

- Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell warns of tighter monetary policy ahead.
- Stocks fell sharply while Treasury yields jumped after Powell's remarks were released.
- Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.
- The central bank has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5-4.75%.
- Inflation is still running at a 5.4% pace annually, well above the Fed's 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.
- Some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon.
