Remember all those celebrities who did crypto ads? They're still rich, but they've been awfully quiet since the industry they shilled has tanked in value.

## Highlights

- Not a single celebrity has said anything since the crypto industry they shilled has tanked in value.
- Larry David made a telling admission through a representative for a FTX ad featuring him.
- Matt Damon, LeBron James, Reese Witherspoon and Gwyneth Paltrow among celebs who did crypto ads.
- University of Chicago's Giovanni Compiani says celebs' boosterism and subsequent silence is particularly insidious because of their wealth.
- "This is real money that people are investing," Compiani said of the crypto craze, adding: "Those who promote it should be more upfront about the potential downsides" The New York Times has also reached out to Matt Damon and LeBron James for comment.
