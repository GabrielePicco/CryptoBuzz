Just a day after disclosing its possible relocation, Coinbase, one of the largest United States crypto exchanges announced its latest achievement...

## Highlights

- Just a day after disclosing its possible relocation, the largest US-based crypto exchange in the US announced its latest achievement of acquiring a Class F license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority.

- Following the obtained license, Coinbase is said to be launching an offshore derivatives exchange platform as soon as next week.
- The offshore exchange will allow for the trading of perpetual swaps tied to cryptocurrencies.
- This raised speculation among the crypto community on how the crypto exchange is planning to cope with the current crypto regulatory scrutiny in US aside from relocating in the region.
