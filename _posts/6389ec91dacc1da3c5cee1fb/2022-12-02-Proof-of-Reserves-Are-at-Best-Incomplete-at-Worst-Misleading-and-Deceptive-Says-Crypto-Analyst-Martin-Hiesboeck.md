Proof-of-reserves Merkle trees are not ideal because they do not \"account for liabilities,\" according to Hiesboeck.

## Highlights

- Many crypto exchanges have seemingly embraced the use of proof-of-reserves (PoR) to showcase their transparency and reassure nervous users.
- Martin Hiesboeck insists such so-called proofs are susceptible to manipulation or misrepresentation.
- PoR Merkle trees have seemingly become the de-facto standard measure used to project a crypto exchange’s transparency.
- But critics say PoRs are not suitable tools for proving the status of an exchange's reserves because they do not “account for liabilities and off-chain assets at all at all” Despite this, several large crypto exchanges appear to have embraced the PoR model.
