Things could get real ugly, real fast for some of these people. It's not a great time to be a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) right now, or really anything crypto-related. However, the exorbitant prices in these JPEG communities are getting hit especially hard as the price of these plummet as much as 80% in just 6 weeks.

## Highlights

- Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is the largest NFT collection on the planet and generally serves as an index for the industry.
- BAYC is getting close to the liquidation point after they over-leveraged themselves by taking out a loan on a popular lending site called "BendDAO" The site allows users to get a loan of up to 40% of their NFT collections's value, which nearly 3% of the entire BAC has since done.
- The implications of this means there are dozens of holders of this collection about to be on the line for as much as $5.3 million.
