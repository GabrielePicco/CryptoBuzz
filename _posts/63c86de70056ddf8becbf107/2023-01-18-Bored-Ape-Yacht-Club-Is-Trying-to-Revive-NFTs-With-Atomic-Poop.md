The creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club are launching their first new NFT collection since last May.

## Highlights

- The Bored Ape Yacht Club is launching their first new NFT collection since last May.
- The Trial of Jimmy the Monkey is an endless runner game where you play until you lose.
- The company behind the launch of the BAYC collection is keeping it mysterious, an apparent attempt at the ol' "under promise, over deliver" strategy.
- The peak of NFTs came in May when Yuga released land deeds for the aforementioned Otherside game, which hit $1 billion in trading volumes over a few days.
- With many economists predicting a recession in 2023, cryptocurrency and NFT's are unlikely to recover to 2022 heights anytime soon.
