Some validators are downgrading their software in an attempt to restore activity.

## Highlights

- Some validators are downgrading their software in an attempt to restore activity.
- A supermajority of validators had switched back to the old software.
- But it did little to solve the still unknown problem that was weighing down performance.
- The effort then turned to a more drastic solution: restarting the chain to the point immediately prior to the forking.
