The German Ministry of Finance has published a letter officially confirming that the sale of crypto assets is tax-free after one year even if the coins are

## Highlights

- The German Ministry of Finance has published a letter on the income taxation of cryptocurrency.
- The sale of acquired crypto assets is tax-free after one year even if the coins are used for staking and lending.
- The finance ministry detailed that in a hearing last year, one of the most intensely discussed questions was whether a 10-year holding period for crypto lending and staking should be a minimum of 10 years.
- In Germany, cryptocurrency is viewed as “a private asset” which means “it attracts an individual income tax rather than a capital gains tax,” crypto tax firm Koinly explained, emphasizing that Germany only taxes crypto if it’s sold within the same year it was bought.
