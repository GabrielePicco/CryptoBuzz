Bitcoin is days from breaking its bear market, analysis says as BTC price struggles below $30,000.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) has a matter of days to go before beginning a new macro uptrend, analysis says.
- The pair’s recent gains have put it above a macro downtrend in place since its 2021 all-time highs.
- The March close would be the first potential candle to complete above that trend line on monthly timeframes.
- Bitcoin spot price action continues to keep market participants guessing as the weekend comes to an end, with a push over $28,000 the first notable event in several days.
- At the time of writing, BTC/USD was back below that level, as shown by data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.
