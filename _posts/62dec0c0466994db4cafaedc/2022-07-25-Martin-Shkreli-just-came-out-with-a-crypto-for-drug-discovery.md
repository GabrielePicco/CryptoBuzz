Druglike, a Web3 drug discovery software platform, co-founded by Martin Shkreli, released a demo, website, and whitepaper detailing its efforts to democratize the costs, access, and rewards of computational drug

## Highlights

- Druglike is a Web3 drug discovery software platform co-founded by Martin Shkreli.
- Co-founder says Druglike will remove barriers to early-stage drug discovery, increase innovation and allow a broader group of contributors to share the rewards.
- Druglike's ability to revolutionize drug discovery is enabled by Web3 technology enabled by Proof-of-Optimization, a novel blockchain consensus mechanism described in the whitepaper.
- Compute contributors can run both solver and validator nodes powering industrial-scale virtual screening campaigns in exchange for $MSI, the platform's official token.
- For more information about Druglike, please refer to the white paper at druglike.com.
