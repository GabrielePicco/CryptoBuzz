The White House published a statement warning about the risks of cryptocurrencies, pointing to last year’s various collapses. I spoke to an administration official about the statement and what it means.

## Highlights

- The White House published a “roadmap to mitigate cryptocurrencies’ risks” last week.
- The statement hints at a more cautious approach toward cryptocurrencies than President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto from last March.
- A senior administration official told me it was part of Team Biden's ongoing efforts to close regulatory gaps within the crypto ecosystem.
- There will be four bankruptcy hearings next week, including a hearing on Celsius’ bidding and the Sam Bankman-Fried bond conditions.
- The hearings are scheduled for Monday and Thursday in the Federal Reserve System, which denied a bid to become a member of the Fed Reserve System's Reserve System.
