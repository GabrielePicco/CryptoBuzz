Crypto lending firm BlockFi loaned out $1.8 billion and held only $1.2 billion in collateral at the end of June, according to its own numbers

## Highlights

- Crypto lending firm BlockFi held $1.8 billion in institutional and retail loan portfolio at end of June.
- Firm's net “exposure’ to a loan counterparty is the fair value of loans minus collateral posted by the counterparty.
- BlockFi CEO Zac Prince has attempted to distance himself and his company from other troubled firms such as Voyager Digital and Celsius, both of which have filed for bankruptcy and frozen user withdrawals.
- At BlockFi, loan collateral is used for lending, investing, and rehypothecation (reusing collateral for BlockFi’s own funding) without the firm needing to retain “a like amount of digital assets”
