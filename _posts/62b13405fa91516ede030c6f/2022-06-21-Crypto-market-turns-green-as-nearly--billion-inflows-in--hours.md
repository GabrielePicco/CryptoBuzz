Over the past week, the entire crypto market was caught in a bearish trend. However, this week it seems to be recovering.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) has come back above the $20,000 mark and pushing toward $21,000.
- Bitcoin had crashed below $19,000 on June 18 before rebounding marginally above, as well.
- The total market cap is now back to $911 billion, up from its lowest point at $844 billion.
- Meanwhile, Terra Classic (LUNC) is the most trending coin after LUNA 2.0, the platform’s original chain, suffered a significant price correction hours after its launch.
- This week the market seems to be recovering, with around $67 billion flowing into the crypto market capitalization in only 24 hours.
