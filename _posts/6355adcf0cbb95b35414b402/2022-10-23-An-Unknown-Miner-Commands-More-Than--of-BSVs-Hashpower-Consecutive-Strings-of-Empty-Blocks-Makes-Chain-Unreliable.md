Today, the unknown miner’s SHA256 hashpower commands around 54% of the Bitcoinsv’s computational power during the last 24 hours.

## Highlights

- An unknown miner has taken over 80% of the Bitcoinsv (Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision) blockchain capturing more than 80% hashpower on October 17, 2022.
- During the last seven days, the stealth miner captured 64.5% of Bitcoinsv's computational power.
- Consecutive blocks of empty blocks makes the Bitcoinv chain unusable for long periods of time.
- The organization behind the BSV project called the Bitcoin Association said it planned to take action against the miner.
- Last year, BSV network endured a 100 block reorg “wiping out 570K transactions,” according to Blockchair, Nikita Zhavoronkov.
