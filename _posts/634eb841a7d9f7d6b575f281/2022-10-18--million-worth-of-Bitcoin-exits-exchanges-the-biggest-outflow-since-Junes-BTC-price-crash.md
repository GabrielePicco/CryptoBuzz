The amount of Bitcoin (BTC) flowing out of cryptocurrency exchanges gained momentum on Oct. 18, suggesting weakening selling pressures that could help BTC

## Highlights

- More than 37,800 BTC left crypto exchanges on Oct.
- 18, according to data tracked by CryptoQuant.
- This marks Bitcoinâ€™s largest daily outflow since June 17, when traders withdrew nearly 68,000 BTC from exchanges.
- More than 121,000 Bitcoin, or nearly $2.4 billion at current prices, has exited the exchanges in the past 30 days.
- Bitcoin whales were mainly behind the coin's strong position near the $18,000 level.
- Bitcoin's technical outlook remains in favor of the bears, given the formation of what appears to be an inverted head-and-handle pattern on the three-day chart.
