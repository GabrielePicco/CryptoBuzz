White House Office of Science and Technology proposes banning bitcoin's energy-intensive proof-of-work mining mechanism. The report said the government \"has a responsibility\" to \"protect\" people from pollution caused by cryptocurrencies. The proposal comes amid

## Highlights

- Bitcoin BTC could be banned in the U.S.
- under a proposal made by the White House Office of Science and Technology.
- The report said the government "has a responsibility" to "protect" people from pollution caused by cryptocurrencies.
- The proposal comes amid a crypto market shake-up caused by ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, beginning its transition to the far more energy-efficient proof-of-stake system.
- The bitcoin network is thought to use roughly as much energy each year as some smaller countries, with the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance recently calculating it consumes around 110 terawatt hours per year, or 0.55% of global electricity production.
