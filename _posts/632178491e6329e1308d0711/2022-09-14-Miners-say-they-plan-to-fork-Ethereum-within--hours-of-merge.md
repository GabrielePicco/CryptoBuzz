Post-merge, Ethereum miners hope to continue a proof-of-work chain and retain their income, no matter how unlikely it is they’ll succeed.

## Highlights

- The group of miners has released a timeline for the fork of the mainnet.
- The mainnet will start at the block height of the Merge block ‘plus’ 2048 EMPTY blocks as padding.
- Block rewards for the empty blocks will be directed to the 1559 multi-sig wallet.
- Post-merge, miners hope to continue a proof-of-work chain and retain their income, no matter how unlikely it is they’ll succeed.
- The exact time will be announced one hour before launch with a countdown timer, the group tweeted.“The Merge block + 2049 will be the 1st block on ETHW that may contain any transactions.”
