Even though cryptocurrencies have lost value, many Argentines see them as a less risky choice than their own currency, whose worth has plunged as inflation has soared.

## Highlights

- One-third of Argentines believed that savings kept in pesos in a local bank would hold onto their value over two years.
- Nearly 60 percent believed that Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, would retain the value of their savings over that same period.
- Many Argentines see them as a less risky choice than their own currency, whose worth has plunged as inflation has soared.
- Many economists blame Argentina’s woes on years of excessive government spending, many economists blame government spending on inflating the country's currency.
- But many Argentines are turning to cryptocurrencies as one way to escape the peso as a way of escaping the crisis.
