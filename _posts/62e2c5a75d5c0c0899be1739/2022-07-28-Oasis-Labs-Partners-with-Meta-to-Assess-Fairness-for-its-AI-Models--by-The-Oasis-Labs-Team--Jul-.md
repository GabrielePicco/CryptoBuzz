## Highlights

- Oasis Labs Partners with Meta to Assess Fairness for its AI Models using Cutting-edge Privacy Technologies.
- First-of-its kind initiative enabling inclusiveness and fairness in AI models.
- Oasis’ technologies focus on making it easier for developers to incorporate privacy-preserving data governance, governance, and responsible data use.
- The cryptographic techniques used by the platform enable Meta to measure for bias and fairness while providing individuals that contribute sensitive demographic measurement data high levels of privacy protection.
- The measurement is computed by the facilitators using encrypted prediction data from AI models, that are cryptographically shared by Meta, with the combined, de-identified results from each facilitator reconstituted into aggregate fairness measurement results by Meta.
