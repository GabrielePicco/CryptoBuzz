Major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is launching an NFT platform where users won’t pay Ethereum transaction costs (gas fees). Customers can sign up for the platform’s waitlist as of Tuesday morning.

## Highlights

- Kraken is launching its own non-fungible token (NFT) platform in the coming months.
- The platform will subsidize transaction costs, such as gas fees, the cost of paying for transactions on ETH and other blockchains.
- It would also give customers the option to custody their assets with the exchange.
- The move comes two weeks after Coinbase Global (COIN) launched its own NFT trading platform, which aims to differentiate itself from other marketplaces like Open Sea by adding a social media twist.
- NFT volumes on the majority of NFTs are created, according to data tracked by on-chain data tracker Nansen.
- The market's trading volumes have risen by 52% over the last 30 days.
