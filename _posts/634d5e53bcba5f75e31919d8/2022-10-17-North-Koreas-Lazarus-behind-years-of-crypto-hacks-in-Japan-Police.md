Japan has put a notice out for Japanese-based crypto companies to be on the lookout for any potential cyberattacks from North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

## Highlights

- Japan’s national police have pinned North Korean hacking group, Lazarus, as the organization behind several years of crypto-related cyber attacks.
- The government has issued a warning to the country's crypto-asset businesses, asking them to stay vigilant of “phishing” attacks by the hacking group aimed at stealing crypto assets.
- The NPA confirmed that several of these attacks have been successfully carried out against Japanese-based digital asset firms, but didn’t disclose any specific details.
- The statement is known as “public attribution,” and according to local reports, is the fifth time in history that the government has warned such a warning.
