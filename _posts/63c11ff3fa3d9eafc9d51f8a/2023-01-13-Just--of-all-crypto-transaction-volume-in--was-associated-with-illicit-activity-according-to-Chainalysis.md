These are lower bound estimates that will likely rise over time as additional illicit activity is discovered

## Highlights

- Every year, we publish our estimates of illicit cryptocurrency activity to demonstrate the power of blockchains’ transparency.
- These kinds of estimates aren’t possible in traditional finance – and to teach investigators and compliance professionals about the latest trends in cryptocurrency-related crime that they need to know about.
- The share of all cryptocurrency activity associated with illicit activity has risen for the first time since 2019, from 0.12% in 2021 to 0.24% in 2022.
- 44% of 2022’s illicit transaction volume came from activity.
- Sanctions-related transaction volume rose 10,012,224.34% from 2021 to 2022 – we do not include that on the graph above.
