Billionaire investor Tim Draper has earned the title \"adventure capitalist\" by betting on a series of notable tech successes, including Hotmail, Skype, SpaceX, AngelList, SolarCity, Twitter, DocuSign, Coinbase, Robinhood

## Highlights

- Tim Draper has earned the title "adventure capitalist" by betting on a series of notable tech successes.
- Draper was an early supporter of Bitcoin BTC/USD and has made early predictions – which for the past eight years have turned out to be correct.
- Draper is still expecting a BTC high of $250,000, but by the end of 2023 – rather than in Q1 2023.
- Draper: "Once people can buy their food, clothing, and housing with Bitcoin, there will be no reason to hold fiat.
- Once the governments realize that they can tax in Bitcoin for walled garden businesses, they will never have another tax cheat"
