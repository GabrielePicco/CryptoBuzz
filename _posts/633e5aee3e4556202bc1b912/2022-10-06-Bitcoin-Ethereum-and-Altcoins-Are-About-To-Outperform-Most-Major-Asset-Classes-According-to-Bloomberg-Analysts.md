Commodity analysts from Bloomberg say that crypto assets are gearing up to outperform the rest of the financial markets.

## Highlights

- Bloomberg analysts say digital asset markets could come to life on the narrative of Bitcoin becoming a risk-off asset rather than being tightly correlated with stock markets.
- Bloomberg analysts are also bullish on the fact that USD-pegged stablecoins, the most widely traded type of crypto assets, primarily rely on the Ethereum network to operate.
- Since 2014, October has been the best month for Bitcoin, averaging gains of about 20%, and in 3Q the BGCI advanced about 16% vs.
- 5% declines for the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500.
- According to the strategists, ETH may be at a point where it becomes more stable than traditional financial instruments during macro bear markets.
