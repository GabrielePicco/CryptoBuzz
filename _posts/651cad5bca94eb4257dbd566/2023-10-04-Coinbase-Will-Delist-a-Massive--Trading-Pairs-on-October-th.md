Some of the affected pairs are ACH-USDT, BNT-BTC, SUSHI-BTC, SUSHI-ETH, ZRX-BTC, ZRX-EUR, and others.

## Highlights

- Coinbase will delist 80 non-USD trading pairs from several of its platforms on October 16, 2023.
- The move aims to “improve overall market health and consolidate liquidity” Advanced Trade users in eligible regions can continue trading these delisted pairs using USDC balances.
- The firm suspended certain trading services in September, too, when delisting BarnBridge (BOND), DerivaDAO (DDX), Jupiter (JUP), Multichain (MULTI), Ooki (OOKI) and Voyager (VGX) The company embraced the asset shortly after a US court ruled in favor of the blockchain enterprise in its lawsuit against the SEC.
