FTX's new CEO appeared on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, contending the company under former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was little beyond a vehicle for funneling customer funds into different ventures.

## Highlights

- FTX CEO John J. Ray III testified before a House of Representatives committee on Tuesday.
- Ray III characterized FTX's actions as “old fashioned embezzlement.” He said the company's founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, made multiple misstatements about his companies’ financials.
- The Justice Department's criminal charges against Bankman are based on an indictment filed under seal by the U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission.
- FTX founder was scheduled to testify via video conference, but the public's opportunity to hear his testimony foreclosed after he was arrested Monday evening by Bahamian authorities.
