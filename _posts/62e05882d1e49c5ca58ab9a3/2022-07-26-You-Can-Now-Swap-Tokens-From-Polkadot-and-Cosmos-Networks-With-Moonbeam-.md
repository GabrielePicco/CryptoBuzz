Polkadot will be the first token that can be used on the cross-chain bridge. Axelar is a bridge network or a platform for cross chain communication for smart contract protocol. Plans are in place to allow the bridging more

## Highlights

- Polkadot and Cosmos are two ecosystems that work on different goals.
- The Axelar Network allows tokens to be transferred across different blockchains.
- Axelar can be described as both a bridge network or a platform for cross chain communication for smart contract protocol.
- In its Series A funding, Moonbeam raised $25,000,000 last year.
- Plans are in place to allow the bridging more Polkadots eco-coins to the Cosmos chain.
- Moonbeam stated that the partnership supports the idea that Polkadota can exist alongside Cosmos, even though they are sometimes viewed as competing ecosystems that are sometimes seen as competing in different goals.
