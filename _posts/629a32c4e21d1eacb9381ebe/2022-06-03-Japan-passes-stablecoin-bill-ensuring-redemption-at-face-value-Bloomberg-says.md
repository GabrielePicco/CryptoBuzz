Governments are looking to protect stablecoin investors after TerraUSD’s implosion led to multibillion-dollar losses from an asset that had been touted as safe.

## Highlights

- Japan’s parliament introduced a legal framework for stablecoins guaranteeing that they are linked to the yen or another fiat currency and that holders have the right to redeem them at face value.
- Governments are looking to ensure protection for stablecoin investors after TerraUSD's implosion led to multibillion-dollar losses from an asset that had been touted as safe.
- The legal framework will take effect in a year, according to the report, Bloomberg said.
- It means stablecoins are essentially digital money, meaning they can be issued only by licensed banks, registered money transfer agents and trust companies, the report said.
- The Financial Services Agency will devise regulations in the coming months.
