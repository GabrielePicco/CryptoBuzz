The amount of bitcoin (BTC) being held on exchanges has been on a steady decline since the bear market began in 2022, but the rate at which investors were

## Highlights

- The amount of bitcoin (BTC) being held on exchanges has been on a steady decline since the bear market began in 2022.
- The rate at which investors were pulling their cryptocurrencies off exchanges has accelerated in the last couple of months.
- This has resulted in one of the sharpest drops in the percent of BTC supply left on centralized exchanges.
- This is a result of the increasing distrust of centralized exchanges following the collapse of FTX.
- BTC is currently trading at $21,231, pushing the market cap above $400 billion once more.
- This could see the digital asset testing the $22,000 resistance level before the week runs out.
