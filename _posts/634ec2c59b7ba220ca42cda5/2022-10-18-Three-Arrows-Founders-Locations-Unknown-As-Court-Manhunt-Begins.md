Unconventional actions are being taken by the liquidators of the collapsed crypto hedge firm Three Arrows Capital to compel the fund's founders into complying

## Highlights

- Liquidators have asked a US judge to allow them to serve subpoenas on 3AC founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies via their social media accounts and email addresses.
- The move comes in light of the failure of attempts to have them cooperate in undertakings that will resolve the matter of giving compensation to investors who lost a lot of money with Three Arrows Capital.
- The bankruptcy of 3AC was initially thought to be induced by the crypto bear market in May.
- But as additional information came out, it appears the collapse was self-inflicted, brought about by unchecked decision making process.
- The U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and US Commodities and Futures
