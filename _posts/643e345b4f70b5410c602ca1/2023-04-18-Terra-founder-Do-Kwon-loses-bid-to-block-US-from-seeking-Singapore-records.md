The creator of the failed Terra stablecoin was arrested in Montenegro in March and charged with fraud by US prosecutors. Read more at straitstimes.com.

## Highlights

- The SEC sued Do Kwon and Terraform Labs in February, alleging that they offered and sold unregistered securities.
- Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March after several months on the run from the authorities in his native South Korea.
- South Korean prosecutors confirmed a report that they were investigating a transfer of funds by Kwon to a top Seoul law firm before Terraâ€™s collapse.
- It is not clear what records the SEC is seeking from MAS, but Terraform was based in Singapore, but the police there said in March that they had launched a probe into the stablecoin's collapse.
- This year's crypto rout dealt a setback to Singapore's earlier embrace of the potential of blockchain technology.
