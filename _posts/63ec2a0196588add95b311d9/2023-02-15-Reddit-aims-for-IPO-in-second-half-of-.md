Social media platform Reddit Inc is looking to go public later this year, likely in the second half, the Information reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

## Highlights

- Social media platform Reddit Inc is looking to go public later this year, the Information reported.
- Reddit and other firms including grocery delivery firm Instacart are keeping their initial public offering paperwork up to date, the report said.
- The IPO market had come to a virtual standstill last year with several high-profile listings on ice as a selloff in high-growth tech stocks and volatility in the capital markets soured investor sentiment.
- Reddit did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
- It had confidentially filed for an IPO in December 2021, after the company's message boards became the go-to destination for day traders during the meme stock frenzy.
