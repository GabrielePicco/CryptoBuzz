- His comment came some hours after Vitalik Buterin condemned the Bitcoin maximalist over the same comment.
- The tweet was greeted with tons of reactions, especially from crypto big guns such as Vitalik buterin, Charles Hoskin, David Schwartz, Adam Back, and others.
- Meanwhile, Bitcoin is now a few steps to The Merge, which will transition the network from the energy-consuming proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof
