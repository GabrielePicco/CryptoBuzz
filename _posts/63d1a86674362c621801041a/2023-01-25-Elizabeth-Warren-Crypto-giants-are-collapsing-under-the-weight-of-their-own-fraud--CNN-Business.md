Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime crypto critic, warned recent turbulence in the digital asset space will only continue unless a host of regulators strengthen protections for investors.

## Highlights

- Warren: "Crypto industry giants... are collapsing under the weight of their own fraud, deceit and gross mismanagement" FTX, Celsius and Voyager all filed for bankruptcy last year as asset prices tanked and the global market capitalization of crypto collapsed by roughly $2 trillion.
- Warren called on regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and banking authorities, to double down on the tools they already have to protect consumers, educate investors and pursue “meaningful consequences” for bad actors, she said.
- The collapse of FTX in November sparked a contagion that is still rippling through crypto markets, which remain largely unregulated and opaque.
