Data shows the Bitcoin mining hashrate has continued its sharp plunge in the past week, as miners give up due to low revenues.

## Highlights

- The “mining hashrate’s value is an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin network.
- The value of the metric seems to have been rapidly trending down in recent days.
- The decrease in the hashrate has been especially rapid during the last week, as the indicator has shed around 10% of its value in the period.
- This kind of trend implies miners aren’t finding the blockchain attractive to mine on at the moment.
- However, the report believes that the market environment is different today, and thus it's unlikely that the miners giving up would have any significant impacts on the price this time.
