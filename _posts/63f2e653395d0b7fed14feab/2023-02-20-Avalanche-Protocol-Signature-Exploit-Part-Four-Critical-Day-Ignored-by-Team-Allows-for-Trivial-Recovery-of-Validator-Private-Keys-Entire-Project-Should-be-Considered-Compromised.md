Part four to a series that explores a critical vulnerability int he way signatures are formed on Avalanche that the team has chosen to willfully ignore.

## Highlights

- After reporting a potent issue in the Golang cryptographic library used by Avalanche on February 14th, 2023, I expected that the team was going to address this issue since it was so obvious and well-documented.
- Since Avalanche chose to screw me out of a $10k bug bounty, I've elected to publish this research for free for the benefit of the community.
- I have a tip jar (Bitcoin) hosted here for all those that would like to show their appreciation or simply contribute.
- The AvalancheGo main repo can be found here.
- The code takes a hexadecimal private key (eeac0e3d8...823e87c) and uses that same library to derive the public key from said private key.
- We then sign a message.
