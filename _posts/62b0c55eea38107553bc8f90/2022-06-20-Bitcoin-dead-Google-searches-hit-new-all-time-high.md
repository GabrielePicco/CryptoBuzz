Rumors and speculation about Bitcoin's demise have long been exaggerated.

## Highlights

- Collapsing Bitcoin (BTC) prices are reviving renewed speculation about the demise of the leading cryptocurrency.
- Google searches for “Bitcoin dead” spiked in the week ending Friday, June 18, and likely reached the highest level on record.
- Google Trends tracks interest in search terms over time, assigning scores of 1 to 100 based on the total number of user queries.
- Bitcoin's downward spiral, now in its seventh month, may have been triggered by the Federal Reserve’s massive shift in policy, which has placed downward pressure on risk assets.
- The implosion of the Terra ecosystem and its related contagion effects has also been a contributing factor.
