Kraken’s incoming CEO, Dave Ripley, said the company will not register with the SEC and will instead continue as it is because it does not offer securities.

## Highlights

- The Securities and Exchange Commission has identified some tokens as securities and called for cryptocurrency platforms to register with the agency as exchanges.
- Instead, Kraken’s incoming CEO, Dave Ripley, said the company will continue as it is because it does not offer securities.
- Ripley added that Kraken would consider acquisitions of companies as it adds a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and institutional client banking services to its portfolio of products and technologies.
- The SEC Chair Gary Gensler has reiterated that he continues to believe that most cryptocurrencies are securities and that crypto trading platforms should be required to register.
- PYMNTS has reached out to Kraken for comment.
