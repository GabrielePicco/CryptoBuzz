Robinhood reported a third-quarter net loss of $175 million, beating the analyst consensus estimate of a $311 million loss, according to FactSet data. Shares rose more than 4% in after-hours trading.

## Highlights

- Retail investing platform's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was back in the black this quarter, totaling $47 million.
- Robinhood's monthly active users decreased by 1.8 million to 12.2 million in September from the prior month, while net revenue rose 14% from the second quarter to $361 million.
- Earlier this year the New York Department of Financial Services hit the firm's crypto division with a $30 million fine, and the firm has twice announced layoffs this year.
- The retail investing platform launched its own crypto wallet at the end of the quarter, as exchanges jostle for dwindling volumes.
