The Republican Congressman and crypto supporter's comments come as former bank regulator and Coinbase exec Brian Brooks said regulators are trying to \"choke off\" crypto.

## Highlights

- Minnesota Rep.
- Tom Emmer accuses FDIC of "weaponizing" authorities to "purpurge legal digital asset entities" Brian Brooks, who was acting Comptroller of the Currency under President Trump, says regulators are trying to "choke off" crypto.
- Emmer's comments come as former bank regulator Brian Brooks says regulators have a "decision" that crypto is "inherently risky" and "needs to be extricated from the banking system" Brooks pushed hard to get banks to support crypto, even proposing a rule change requiring banks to "provide access to services, capital, and credit based on risk assessment" rather than broad-based decisions affecting individual customers.
