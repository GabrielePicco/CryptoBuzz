Russian authorities have finally reached an agreement on how to tackle crypto by imposing regulations instead of a ban.

## Highlights

- Russia's central bank and government have decided to draft a bill on recognizing crypto as an analog of currencies.
- The authorities have until February 18th to present the draft law.
- The early stages of the law suggest that all crypto transactions of over 600,000 rubles (about $8,000) will have to be declared or risk being labeled as a criminal offense.
- Russia’s population is among the most active on the crypto market, with recent Kremlin estimations showing that they own over $200 billion worth of digital assets.
- The country's president – Vladimir Putin – seemed in favor of regulations instead of a ban as well and backed crypto mining.
