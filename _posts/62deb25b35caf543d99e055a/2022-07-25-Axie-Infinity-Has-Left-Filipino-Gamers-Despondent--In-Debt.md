Thousands of Filipino players entered the crypto game last year, only for predatory structures to arise. Then the game's economy crashed.

## Highlights

- The game, Axie Infinity, was created by a Vietnam-based startup called Sky Mavis Inc.
- It's part of the rising play-to-earn gamer movement.
- Players can earn in-game currency called Smooth Love Potion (SLP), which can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.
- The game initially made a huge impact in the Philippines, where players made up 40% of the game’s user base.
- Most Filipino players, including Samerson Orias, have exited the game nursing anger and anxiety—and, in some cases, thousands of dollars down.
- Orias grew to hate playing the game, a common refrain among the dozen players TIME interviewed for this story.
