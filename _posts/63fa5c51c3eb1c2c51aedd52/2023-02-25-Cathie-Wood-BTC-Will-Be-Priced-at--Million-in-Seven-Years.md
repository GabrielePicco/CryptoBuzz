Cathie Wood of Ark Invest is confident that the bitcoin price could hit a whopping $1.5 million when 2030 gets here.

## Highlights

- Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management is confident that bitcoin will reach a price of $1.5 million by 2030.
- Wood believes the currency could reach a whopping 6,000 percent from where it is currently trading at $23,000 per unit.
- This is a huge increase over the past few weeks alone.
- 2022 was the worst year for bitcoin on record, losing more than $2 trillion in valuation.
- Wood says the fall of FTX, the once golden child of the digital currency arena, could help bitcoin in that FTX – along with many other major players – have been forced out of the market.
