Reddit recently launched its own collection of NFT avatars, and not only did they all sell out, but 2.5 million Reddit Vault wallets were created to buy the 40,000 token collection. NFTs gained a negative reputation

## Highlights

- Reddit recently launched its own collection of NFT avatars, or 'collectible tokens' NFTs gained a negative reputation in 2021 during the last cryptocurrency bubble.
- The platform avoided using crypto lingo and selling the avatars in dollars instead of crypto.
- 2.5 million Reddit Vault wallets were created to buy the 40,000 token collection.
- Reddit's active users outperformed OpenSea despite having a user base that is notoriously anti-NFT.
- The avatars were designed by artists within the Reddit community who were paid for every sale.
- The sale was not a blatant cash-grab by Reddit, unlike many companies that joined the NFT craze.
