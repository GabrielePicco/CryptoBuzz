Ethereum wrapped up its first big dress rehearsal for a long-awaited makeover that's been repeatedly pushed back for the last several years.

## Highlights

- Developers say the latest test run on Wednesday was very smooth, an important marker as the blockchain for the second-largest cryptocurrency gears up for its landmark makeover.
- Developers said the test hit "some minor known issues," and developers "will be spending the next few days triaging them" The price of ether, the token native to the ethereum blockchain, has lost about half its value this year and is trading at just over $1,800.
- The new proof-of-stake proposal would require interested users to have only 32 ether, or about $57,600, in order to use the system.
- To lower the barrier to entry, users would need to have around $2.7 million.
