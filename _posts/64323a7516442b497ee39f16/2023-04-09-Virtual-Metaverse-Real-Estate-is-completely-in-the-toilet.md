Only a handful of users are actually trading virtual real estate on Decentraland, slices of land that are being sold inside the virtual world as NFTs.

## Highlights

- Virtual real estate platform Decentraland, once valued at $1 billion, is in free fall.
- Only a handful of users are actually trading virtual real estate on the platform.
- The company's woes are symptomatic of a much bigger decline in interest in owning real estate.
- Other platforms including The Sandbox have been seriously struggling to draw in serious numbers of users as well.
- Architect Hunter Swihart says he wouldn't be surprised if the company would go under in the near future.
- The Block reports that only between 20 and 30 people are actually buying and selling property on a weekly basis, amounting to roughly $50,000.
