The U.S. is almost certain to enter a recession, according to Bloomberg Economics. How will transparent, math-based cryptocurrencies fare?

## Highlights

- Bloomberg Economics: The chance of a recession in the U.S.
- has now hit 100%.
- Bloomberg: It is "effectively certain" the country's economy will contract over the next year.
- Bitcoin, the first and foremost cryptocurrency, was born out of a global economic recession, but has never existed inside one.
- Bitcoin's fixed, mathematics-based "tokenomics" of major cryptocurrencies has come into sharper contrast with the fixed, math-based economic policy for fiat currencies.
- The price of Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies, will be closely tied to macro factors, including rate hikes from the Fed, experts say.
