Bitcoin is beginning to rally following Ethereum’s surge on Monday.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin trading at $22,460 at 15:20 UST, it quickly surged to $23,160 just 16 minutes later.
- $630 million has been liquidated from the crypto market within the last 24 hours.
- Some suspect that the surge is due to excitement about the Merge update, which has now been given a specific date of arrival.
- Bitcoin now appears to be showing its own unique momentum, with the price of Bitcoin at a price point it hasn’t seen in over a month.
- The sudden surge has liquidated over $600 million in trades, with $377 million cleared from ETH trades, given its especially pronounced bounce from Monday.
