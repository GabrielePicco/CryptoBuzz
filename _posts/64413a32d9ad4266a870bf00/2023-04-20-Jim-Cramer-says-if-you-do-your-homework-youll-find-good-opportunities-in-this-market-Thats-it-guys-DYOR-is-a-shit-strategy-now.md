Three companies that saw trading swing on earnings this week were opportunities for investors to look past early bias and buy in.

## Highlights

- Cramer: Three companies that saw trading swing on earnings this week showcased opportunities for investors to buy in.
- Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Abbott Labs were examples of opportunities, he said.
- Cramer said investors can look past early bias and buy in when the rest of the market is skittish.
- That's because they're able to disregard short-term chatter and look at the metrics that matter, he added.
- The actual hitters are able to step up and win while other investors sell off or hold themselves back amid morning lows, Jim Cramer says.
- The real hitters, the people who do enough homework," he said, step up.
