Hackers pulled off a $620 million crypto heist by tricking an engineer into applying for a fake job and opening an offer letter containing spyware, report says | Business Insider Africa

## Highlights

- Hackers tricked an engineer into applying for a fake job and sending him a fake offer letter laced with spyware.
- The cyberattack is believed to be one of the largest crypto heists in the world.
- The US Treasury sanctioned virtual currency mixer Blender.io, which the Treasury alleged was used to obscure the source of over $20.5 million of the cryptocurrency stolen from Axie Infinity, in May.
- Experts said the cyberattack shouldn't be a deterrent to widespread crypto adoption, as the heist was largely due to human error and a lack of cybersecurity rather than a flaw in blockchain technology itself, experts told Business Insider in April.
