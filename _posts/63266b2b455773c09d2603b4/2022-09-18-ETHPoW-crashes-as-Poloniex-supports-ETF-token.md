The fork’s ETHW token dropped 70% on technical glitches and early supporter Poloniex's decision to back a different, little-known blockchain.

## Highlights

- A proposed fork was scheduled to happen a day after the Merge.
- Everyone who held ether (ETH) would be entitled to receive the same amount of the new blockchain’s native token, ETHW, with an airdrop.
- The fork's ETHW token dropped 70% on technical glitches and early supporter Poloniex's decision to back a different, little-known blockchain.
- The new version of the blockchain would retain the mining-based proof-of-work consensus mechanism after the merge.
