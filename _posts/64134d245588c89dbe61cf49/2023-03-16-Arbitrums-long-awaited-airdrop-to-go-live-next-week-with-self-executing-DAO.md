The governance token will be handed out to those who have interacted with the network — and some DAOs, too.

## Highlights

- Layer 2 project Arbitrum will airdrop a governance token with the ticker ARB to its community members on March 23.
- The token will control the governance of the Arbitrum One and Nova networks through a self-executing DAO.
- The airdop will represent 12.75% of the token’s total supply, and tokens will be handed to those who have used the network over the last year.
- Arbitrum also released Arbitrum Orbit, a way for developers to build Layer 3 networks on top of Arbitrum.
- The new governance system will be able to approve licenses for other Layer 2 networks using Arbitrum's technology.
