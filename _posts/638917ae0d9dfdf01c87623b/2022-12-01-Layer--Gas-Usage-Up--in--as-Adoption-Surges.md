Arbitrum Continues to Lead Sector After Nitro Upgrade and OpenSea Integration

## Highlights

- Novemberâ€™s L2 gas spend is already at 89B units, up from 76.6B for all of October and up 170% since the year began.
- Layer 2 networks are the leading scaling solutions for the Bitcoin network.
- L2 chains offer a massive reduction in transaction costs while inheriting the robust security of the mainnet.
- Arbitrum is the leading network with 53% of the sector's combined TVL, followed by Optimism with 28%.
- The network has $4.3B in total value locked, with Arbitrum and Optimism currently using optimistic rollups, which compromise on scalability in exchange for compatibility with the EVM (EVM)
