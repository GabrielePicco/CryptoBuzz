Square Enix has finally revealed the Symbiogenesis project, and it turns out it's an NFT drop rather than the Parasite Eve return hoped for.

## Highlights

- Square Enix trademarked 'Symbiogenesis' - a term relating to merging two entities into one complete being - but it turns out it's an NFT drop rather than Parasite Eve.
- Symbiogenesis is the publisher’s ‘first digital collectible art project designed from the ground up for Web3 fans’ It's described as ‘entertainment content’ that involves keen fans in an interactive story, with each NFT purchased helping to solve a mystery of a sort.
- The launch, set for Spring 2023 [Northern Hemisphere], appears to be part of a major push into the NFT space by Square Enix.
