Crypto enthusiasts in the UK are bracing themselves for sweeping legislation that could turn the tide for the industry. The FCA

## Highlights

- The FCA will limit the amount individuals can invest in the cryptocurrency markets to 10% of net assets.
- The move is designed to protect investors from the risks associated with the market.
- The UKâ€™s Financial Conduct Authority has also announced a ban on advertising in the market for those who want to invest in a way that they can be guaranteed a certain amount of money.
- Three Arrows Capital was forced to pull out of the market last month after it defaulted on its loans.
- The new law is expected to change the way the market operates in the near future, according to the FCA, who say the law is necessary to make sure all companies that use the law are aware of the risks.
