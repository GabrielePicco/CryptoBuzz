Stablecoins are under scrutiny due to anomalies in price. Does SEC have the tools and expertise to efficiently regulate stablecoins, or should OCC maintain charge in regulation?

## Highlights

- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has experience in managing payment and settlement systems and is well-suited to regulate stablecoins.
- It is essential to have a regulatory body that understands the risks associated with stablecoins and has the necessary expertise to oversee them.
- The SEC has the mandate to regulate securities, but it may not have the expertise to regulated stablecoins effectively, says Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire.
- Even though stablecoins share some similarities with securities, their primary purpose as a medium of exchange sets them apart from traditional securities, which falls outside the jurisdiction of the SEC.
- Stablecoins are under scrutiny due to anomalies in price.
