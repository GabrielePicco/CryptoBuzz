title:  "Binance gave Putin regime information on users who donated to opposition leader Alexei Navalny"
description: "Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, shared customer data with the Russian government according to a Reuters special report. Reuters detailed how Binance provided the Russian government's financial monitoring service with data on Binance users who donated to Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist and prominent opponent of Putin. Reuters reported this was part of a broader effort by Binance to form allegiances with Russian governmental agencies as it worked to expand its footprint in Russia.Navalny has been imprisoned in Russia since returning in January 2021, shortly after recovering from poisoning: an attempt on his life reportedly ordered by Putin. While in prison, Navalny's foundation has encouraged people to donate cryptocurrency using Binance. They have raised more than 670 Bitcoin ($28 million) so far, despite the Russian government outlawing the foundation and labeling it a terrorist organization. Donors to Navalny's cause now face potentially serious danger as they've been identified to the Putin regime by Binance.Crypto proponents have long promoted the technology's potential to fund individuals who are targeted by oppressive regimes, and to allow anonymous and untraceable donations."

## Highlights

- Binance used Twitter's branded hashtag feature to add a custom emoji to Twitter when people use the hashtags #Binance or #BNB.
- The emoji closely resembled the Hindu swastika, which represents good luck and prosperity.
- In Germany the symbol is banned except when used in explicitly religious contexts.
- Several hours later, Binance changed the emoji to a globe with the Binance logo.
- Binance provided the Russian government's financial monitoring service with data on Binance users who donated to Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist and prominent opponent of Putin.
- While in prison, Navalny's foundation has raised more than 670 Bitcoin ($28 million) so far.
