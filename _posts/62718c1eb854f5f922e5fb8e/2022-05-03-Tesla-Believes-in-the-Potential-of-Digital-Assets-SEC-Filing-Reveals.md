After over a year of Elon Musk’s public love-hate relationship with crypto, Tesla has taken a more favorable stance.

## Highlights

- Tesla leaves the door open for more cryptocurrency investment in the future.
- The electric car company’s quarterly report SEC filing does not mention if or when the company will accept payment in the form of digital assets.
- Tesla reported $1.26 billion in holdings in digital assets in its first quarter earnings report last month.
- Elon Musk's love-hate relationship with cryptocurrencies has been playing out on the public stage for over a year.
- Tesla has long held an interest in a different cryptocurrency — the so-called meme coin Dogecoin.
- Tesla now accepts payments in Dogecoins on its online shop for select items, although its earnings report did not note any revenue from DogeCoin payments.
