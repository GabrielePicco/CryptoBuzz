In an NFT world fraught with frauds, few pause to check for fakes: ‘The crypto mindset is they know it’s chaos and bullshit and they don’t care’

## Highlights

- Thousands of investors and enthusiasts attended NFT.NYC this week to talk about buying and selling non-fungible tokens.
- Snoop Dogg impersonator was hired “last minute” by a crypto startup to grab attention at the conference.
- The impostor called himself “Doop Snogg” applied makeup, glued on a fake moustache, and stuffed paper in his shoes to appear taller.
- Many pro-crypto celebs have quietly retreated from view as the NFT market has plummeted by 92% since its peak last September.
- The largest NFT platform, OpenSea, estimated 80% of NFTs created through its tools were fraudulent.
