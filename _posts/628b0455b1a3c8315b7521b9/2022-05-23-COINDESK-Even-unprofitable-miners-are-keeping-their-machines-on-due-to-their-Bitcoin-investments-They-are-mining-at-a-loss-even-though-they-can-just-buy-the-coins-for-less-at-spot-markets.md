Reported hashrate fell to zero for two months in China last year, but it has since returned rather abruptly.

## Highlights

- Cambridge University’s Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) released an update to its heavily cited (and rightfully so) Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) Last week, the update showed that China's share of mining went from 0.0% in August 2021 to … 22.3% in September 2021.
- The CCAF, recognizing the oddity of the data, published a wonderfully titled blog post about their update leaving us with this: Most miners are more properly characterized as commercial operations, paying triple net leases for warehouse space and depending on fancy power purchase agreements for electricity.
- Hashrate – the computational power of the Bitcoin network – has grown 40% since the China ban.
