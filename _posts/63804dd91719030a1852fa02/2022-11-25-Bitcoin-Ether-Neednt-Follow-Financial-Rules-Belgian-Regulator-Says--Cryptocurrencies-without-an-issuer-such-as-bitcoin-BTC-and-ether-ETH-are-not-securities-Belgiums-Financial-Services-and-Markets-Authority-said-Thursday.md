Officials hope to fend off a rising number of questions about how crypto should be regulated and when they should be treated as securities.

- That means they must produce an honest prospectus of information for potential investors.
- But cryptocurrencies like bitcoin don't count as they don't have an issuer.
- Officials hope to fend off a rising number of questions about how crypto should be regulated and when they should be treated as securities.
