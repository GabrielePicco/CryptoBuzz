Things are bad. But at least ‘you can eat’ one of these assets.

## Highlights

- Robert Kiyosaki warns of 'biggest crash in world history': 'We’ve never had this much debt pumped up' He says he avoids ‘anything that can be printed, like a stock certificate, a bond, or a dollar,” he says in a Kitco News interview.
- Gold, silver, bitcoin and other precious metals are the things he prefers instead of stock market stock market.
- He also says he's 'optimistic and bullish' on Bitcoin, which he bought when it hit $6,000, and is ready to buy again if the downtrend continues the dip again if it goes down.
