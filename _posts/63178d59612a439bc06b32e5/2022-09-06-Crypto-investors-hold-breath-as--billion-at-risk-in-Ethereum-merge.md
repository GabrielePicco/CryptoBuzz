The transformation promises to deliver huge energy efficiencies and reduce costs for users

## Highlights

- The $200 billion-market-cap cryptocurrency promises to deliver huge energy efficiencies.
- But the scale and complexity of the project means one wrong move could spark shockwaves across the wider crypto market.
- The price of the coin has risen 5% over the past five days, as investors pinned their hopes on the efficiency gains to make it a more widely-accepted means of payment.
- Last year, Tesla boss Elon Musk said the carmaker would stop accepting Bitcoin as a payment for its vehicles, citing concerns over the amount of fossil-fuel generated electricity used to mine the coin.
- Bitcoin mining has consumed more electricity than that consumed in the UK over the same period.
