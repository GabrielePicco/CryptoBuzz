Turkey: Inflation has hit its highest level in 24 years, standing at at 78.62%, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute.

## Highlights

- Turkey's inflation rate has hit its highest level in 24 years, with the annual inflation rate now at 78.62%.
- The Turkish Statistical Institute published the figure, with a monthly increase of 4.95%.
- There are several reasons why the rate has risen to such an astronomical figure, including the increasing cost of energy and the weakening of the Turkish lira.
- The government has revealed a scheme that will bring gold savings at home into the banking system.
- It estimates that there is approximately $250 to $350 billion in gold in homes.
- Individuals have often turned to crypto as a hedge against inflation, though that argument seems to be losing its strength.
