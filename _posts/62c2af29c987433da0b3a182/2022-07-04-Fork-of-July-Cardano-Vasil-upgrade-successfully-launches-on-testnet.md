The Cardano blockchain’s testnet has completed the Vasil hard fork, which improves scalability for decentralized apps and upgrades efficiency for developers.

## Highlights

- The Cardano testnet has completed the Vasil hard fork on the Cardano blockchain.
- The mainnet is expected to be hard-forked in about four weeks.
- The upgrade will allow faster block creation and greater scalability for decentralized apps.
- Developers are encouraged to deploy their work on the testnet to ensure integrations run smoothly.
- Cardano’s top DApp with $49.7 million in total value locked (TVL) is currently the DEX WingRiders, according to the DeFi data compiler DefiLlama.
- The testnet hard fork has done little to move Cardano as it is only up 0.1% over the last 24 hours to $0.45.
