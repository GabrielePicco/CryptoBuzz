The total value locked in Algorand DeFi applications has received a boost this week after Hivemind announced a $25 million allocation.

## Highlights

- The total value locked on Algorand hit $270 million for the first time today.
- Hivemind Capital deployed $25 million worth of capital in AlgorAnd DeFi, giving the Layer 1 chain a liquidity injection.
- The total volume of transactions on the layer 1 chain has increased by 269% since the start of the year.
- The rise may be shortlived due to the macro climate, but with global macroeconomic turmoil showing no signs of letting up, it may be difficult to keep growing at a similar pace going forward going forward, although other Layer 1 chains like Avalanche and Solana continue to drop in activity.
- In addition, the total value on the other layer 1 chains has dropped by 86%.
