Maintaining a feelgood atmosphere is now a job aimed at keeping prospective investors interested – and distracting holders from a troubled market

## Highlights

- The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has been locked in a downward spiral, with sales on one popular platform falling to less than one-seventh of their January peak.
- To shore things up, NFT projects have turned to a new kind of role: the vibes manager.
- The job is something of a cross between a marketer, influencer and investor relations officer.
- The goal?
- To keep things positive, no matter what - it’s just a vibe shift.
- NFTs are virtually unregulated, have seen wild swings in prices over the years, fueled by promises that blockchain might solve all sorts of real-world problems.
