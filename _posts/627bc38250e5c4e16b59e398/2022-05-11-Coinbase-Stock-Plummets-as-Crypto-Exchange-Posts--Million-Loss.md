Coinbase’s monthly transacting users dropped to 9.2 million, coming in shy of analysts’ estimate of 9.5 million.

## Highlights

- Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase missed on analysts’ estimates for first quarter revenue.
- The exchange said that broader market conditions are to blame, but it is not afraid of a bear market.
- Shares plummeted 12% in after-hours trading; the company said it expects a further decline in transactions in the second quarter, but its outlook for 2022 is “largely unchanged,” in its shareholder letter Tuesday.
- The company has said it wants to diversify from trading fee revenue, moving into futures and derivatives products, prime brokerage offerings, and, most recently, a subscription model that comes with zero-fee transactions.
- The exchange collected $152 million in revenue from subscription and services.
