Legal experts have pointed out a shocking loophole that may actually work in the favor of Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's youthful head.

## Highlights

- FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried may end up facing significant legal peril.
- Legal experts have pointed out a loophole that may actually work in the favor of him.
- Prosecutors will have to establish that he intended to commit a crime, rather than just being terrible at handling billions in crypto.
- Prosecution under Section 1343 carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence, which could put the 30-year-old crypto CEO away for a significant period.
- Neither he nor any of his alleged polycule members and/or fellow executives at FTX have been charged with any crime, but as it stands now, prosecutors may have a hard job proving they weren't just millennials who suck at money and business management.
