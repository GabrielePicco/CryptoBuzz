Crypto investors have assively redeemed around $3.5 billion worth of stablecoin in the last two weeks following FTX's implosion.

## Highlights

- Investors are massively redeeming their stablecoin holdings for fiat following the recent market conditions that have eroded trust in centralized exchanges.
- The fear was also spread to Binance-backed BUSD, which has been on an upward trend all year round.
- Meanwhile, some stablecoins like Pax Dollar and USDC have seen their supply grow amidst this chaos.
- There was a redemption of about $3.5 billion worth of stablecoins over the last 14 days coinciding with the collapse of FTX.
- There are many speculations as to what could have been responsible.
