Bitcoin prices have climbed quite a bit in recent months, rising from less than $16,000 to nearly $24,000 today. The digital currency has managed to push higher in the face of industry headwinds.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin prices have experienced some very compelling gains in the last few months.
- The digital currency reached $23,950 today on CoinDesk, up 53% from the local low of roughly $15,600 in November.
- Goldman Sachs had proclaimed bitcoin the best-performing asset of 2023 after conducting an analysis earlier this month.
- Digital currency has experienced these sharp gains in spite of the ongoing difficulty in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, which has been reeling from difficult, high-visibility events like the collapse of troubled exchange FTX and news regarding the upcoming trial of its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.
- The market is largely unregulated and the market is highly speculative.
