On Thursday, a court ruling went against the SEC. The ruling came ahead of a key court ruling on the Hinman speech documents, likely next week.

## Highlights

- XRP avoided the dayâ€™s Major Support and Resistance Levels, while resistance at $0.40 pegged XRP back.
- Near-term, price action remains hinged on news updates from the SEC v Ripple case.
- The ruling came ahead of a key court ruling on the Hinman speech documents, likely next week, on whether they fall under attorney-client privilege.
- It is unclear whether the scales have tipped in Ripple's favor with a key ruling on Hinman's speech-related documents.
- Despite bearish sentiment across the broader crypto market, XRP found late support to limit the downside, limiting the downside of the downside.
- The Court agreed with Ripple and said that the SEC was trying to seal more than necessary
