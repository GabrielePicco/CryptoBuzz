More than 75% of the BTC supply is in the hands of Bitcoin long-term holders — a new all-time high.

## Highlights

- A record 76.2% of the Bitcoin network is locked up with long-term holders today, Glassnode data shows.
- That's a first in Bitcoin's lifespan, says Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments.
- LTHs control more of the BTC supply than at any point in history, the data suggests.
- Short-term hodlers (STH) are also of major interest to market observers.
- The realized price of the STH cohort has functioned as support during much of this year, and this week, fresh data shows that trend remains in play.
- The STH realized price — the price at which all STH-owned coins last moved — sits at just below $27,000.
