JPMorgan said in a note to investors Wednesday that major crypto exchanges have experienced \"severe\" outflows since the FTX crash.

## Highlights

- Investors are pulling funds out of major crypto exchanges as a result of the collapse of FTX, JPMorgan analysts say.
- FTX was one of the most popular digital asset exchanges but last week imploded—losing billions of dollars of investors’ cash.
- JPMorgan said all major exchanges experienced outflows last week but Gemini, OKX and Crypto.com had the most “severe” draining of funds.
- The stablecoin market is getting smaller, and this may continue to hurt the price of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the largest by market cap, hit a two-year low following the fall of the FTX crash.
- The fall sent shockwaves through the crypto market, sending prices of major coins and tokens plunging.
