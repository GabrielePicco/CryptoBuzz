The company faces a difficult choice between shareholder dilution and effective employee compensation, the report said.

## Highlights

- Goldman Sachs downgrade was due to the continued fall in crypto prices and the ensuing fall in industry activity levels.
- Goldman sees revenue base falling 61% year-on-year in 2022, and about 73% in the back half of the year.
- Robinhood Markets (HOOD) upgraded to “neutral” from “sell” with a $9.50 price target.
- Goldman is more bearish on the competitive environment and the outlook for fee rate compression given the merging of the two platforms, which has the potential to reduce switching costs and make lower pricing more available to users.
- The company faces a difficult choice between shareholder dilution and effective employee compensation.
