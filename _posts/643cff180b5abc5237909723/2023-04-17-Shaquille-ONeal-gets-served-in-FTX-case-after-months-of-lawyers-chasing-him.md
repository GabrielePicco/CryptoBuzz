The basketball great shilled for FTX before its collapse in November. O'Neal is among several celebrities served in a class action case.

## Highlights

- Shaquille O'Neal is among more than a dozen celebrities and sports teams being sued for promoting FTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange.
- Lawyers finally served O’Neal at his home on Sunday afternoon, and say the exchange was captured on video.
- The case illustrates how difficult it can be to serve a celebrity, even one who often appears in public.
- Lawyers had been so desperate to find O‘Neal ahead of a Monday deadline that they asked a judge to allow them to serve him via Twitter, Instagram and email.
- The NBA great has sought to distance himself from FTX in the wake of the company’s collapse.
