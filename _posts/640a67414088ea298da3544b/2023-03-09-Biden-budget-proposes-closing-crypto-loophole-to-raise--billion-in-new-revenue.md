Biden's budget proposal rolled out Thursday included a new provision that would close a loophole currently available to crypto investors that could raise up to $24 billion in revenue.

## Highlights

- President Biden's budget proposal includes a proposal to change the tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions.
- Currently, crypto sales arenâ€™t subject to the same rules that investors in stocks or bonds have to follow.
- The new provision would raise $24 billion, according to the White House.
- Biden already passed a crypto-related tax provision that was tucked in his 2021 infrastructure act.
- The Treasury Department later clarified that miners, validators, and other crypto users will not be classified as crypto "brokers" under tax reporting rules.
- Federal Reserve Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr emphasized that the same regulations that safeguard banks should apply to crypto if the activity is analogous without squashing innovation.
