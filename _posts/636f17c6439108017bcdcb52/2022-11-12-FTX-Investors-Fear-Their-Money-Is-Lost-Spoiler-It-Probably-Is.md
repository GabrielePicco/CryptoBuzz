FTX was supposed to be bought by Binance. Now investors are worried they’ll lose all their money.

## Highlights

- The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan sunk $75 million into troubled global cryptocurrency exchange FTX International.
- The pension plan is one of many entities affected by the unraveling of FTX and its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried.
- On Friday, FTX announced that it would file for bankruptcy and resigning as CEO after the company couldn’t find enough capital to stay afloat.
- The company has appointed John J. Ray III, who helped oversee Enron's unwinding, to lead FTX’s parent company.
- Every day investors, along with celebrity endorsers, venture-capital firms and others are all facing deep uncertainty in the aftermath.
