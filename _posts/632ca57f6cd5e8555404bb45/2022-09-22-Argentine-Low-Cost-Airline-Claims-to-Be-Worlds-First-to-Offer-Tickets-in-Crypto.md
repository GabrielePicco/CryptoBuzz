Flybondi has forged a strategic alliance with TravelX, and will sell ‘NFTickets’ for seats

## Highlights

- Argentine low-cost airline Flybondi will be able to buy tokenized tickets through Binance Pay.
- The airline claims to be the first carrier in the world to offer tokenized air tickets, or ‘NFTickets’ The feature is the ‘tokenization’ of an airline ticket via blockchain technology, which also allows a passenger’s name to be reassigned once purchased, and makes it possible for the ticket to be transferred or resold to another person up to three days before the departure date.
- ‘Very soon we will see many other airlines follow suit” says TravelX CEO and co-founder Juan Pablo Lafosse.
