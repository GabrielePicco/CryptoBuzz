- The leading cryptocurrency jumped in the late hours on Sunday to hit a seven-day high of $30,723.
- Bitcoin is down 18.63% so far this month, following a 17.3% loss in gains in April.
- The major question now is whether the industry's largest asset can maintain its momentum after the latest price action.
