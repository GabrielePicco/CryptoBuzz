While bitcoin itself is difficult to confiscate or censor, U.K. courts have labeled bitcoin as property which aids in recovery when scammers try to cash out.

## Highlights

- Matthew Green and Brian Mondoh, contributors for Bitcoin Magazine, write an opinion editorial.
- Bitcoin is one of the most valuable assets for criminals utilizing blockchain technology.
- Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general could be treated as “real property” like any other asset, and (theoretically) be frozen, transferred and dealt with like other property such as a car, a house or a house.
- The “AA v Persons Unknown” case saw the first proprietary injunction over bitcoin.
- This means that the bitcoin paid — or its traceable proceeds, in instance those found at Bitfinex — were frozen and subject to the determination of the English High Courts.
