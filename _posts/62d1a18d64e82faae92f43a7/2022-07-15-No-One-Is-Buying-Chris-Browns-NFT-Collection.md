After a week on sale, only about 3% of NFTs in the 10,000-piece collection have been sold.

## Highlights

- A new collection of 10,000 NFTs has been launched by Brown.
- After a week on sale, only 3% of the collection have been sold.
- The collection is aimed at Brown's fans, with the website promising VIP concert tickets, meet and greets and video calls with Brown.
- Over $25 billion was spent on NFT collections last year, a huge pile of cash that many celebrities and the mainstream public have unsuccessfully tried to get a cut of.
- Many of the popular collections sell out in under an hour, many in under a minute, but not all of them have sold so far.
- The market has seen the price of ether drop 67% since the beginning of the year.
