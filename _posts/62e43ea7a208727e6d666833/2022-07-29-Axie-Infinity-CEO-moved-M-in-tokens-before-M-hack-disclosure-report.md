Sky Mavis claimed that founders transferred out tokens to allow more “flexibility” in its response to the Ethereum sidechain attack.

## Highlights

- Axie Infinity’s Ronin network was hacked in March, with $622 million worth of assets stolen as of the time of disclosure.
- Sky Mavis CEO Trung Nguyen transferred $3 million of the game's AXS governance token to Binance just three hours before the hack was disclosed.
- He says claims of insider trading are "baseless" and that the move was to allow more 'flexibility' in its response to the attack.
- The US Treasury alleges the stolen assets were stolen by the North Korean hacking group, Lazarus, which is believed to be responsible for the hack.
- The hack closed off access to the network until late June, and all users were reimbursed.
