A working paper released by the Federal Reserve looks at how a central bank digital currency would impact monetary policy.

## Highlights

- A working paper released by the Federal Reserve looks at how a central bank digital currency would impact monetary policy.
- The paper considered four scenarios that illustrate the potential effects of a retail CBDC on monetary policy from the perspective of three stakeholder groups: the Fed, commercial banks and U.S.
- households.
- The study is the latest sign of the flurry of activity around CBDCs in the United States and other countries.
- The authors of the study say the Fed could use existing tools to manage the impact of the digital currency on policy implementation.
- If interest rates rise too abruptly, the Fed would turn to the discount window and standing repo facility to moderate the rates.
