CoinFlex said it would issue $47 million of a digital coin it is calling Recovery Value USD after the company halted withdrawals for customers.

## Highlights

- CoinFlex halted withdrawals for customers last week citing "uncertainty involving a counterparty" A long-time customer's account went into "negative equity" that prompted the company to halt withdrawals.
- The company is offering a 20% interest rate for people willing to buy Recovery Value USD, or rvUSD.
- CEO Mark Lamb said he believes the investor will repay the company "at some point in the future" He added that the company has "alternative mechanisms" if it can't raise money from issuing the new token.
- It hopes to resume withdrawals on June 30 and restore the platform to full functionality, CEO Lamb said in a post.
