Bitcoin jumped by almost $1,000 in minutes, as the US announced a small decline in the Consumer Price Index metric.

## Highlights

- The United States government just released the latest CPI data, indicating that inflation has finally begun to ease following several consecutive months with record-setting numbers.
- Bitcoin jumped by almost $1,000 in minutes as the US announced a small decline in the Consumer Price Index metric.
- As with previous examples, the price of bitcoin reacted almost immediately with a surge towards $24,000.
- The price increase could be related to investorsâ€™ general approach to the asset class since the CPI numbers give a broad suggestion of what the Federal Reserve could do in the next meeting in September.
- However, the cryptocurrency could be inclined to more volatility in the following hours, history shows.
