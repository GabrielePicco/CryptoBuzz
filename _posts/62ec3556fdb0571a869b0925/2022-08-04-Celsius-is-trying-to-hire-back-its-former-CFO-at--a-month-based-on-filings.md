Cash strapped cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network wishes to bring back former CFO Rod Bolger and pay him $92,000 per month

## Highlights

- Celsius Network wants to bring back former CFO Rod Bolger and pay him $92,000 per month.
- It wants to pay Bolger $120,000 a month, prorated over a period of at least six weeks.
- Celsius Network had been one of the biggest crypto lending platforms with a market value (before Chapter 11) of $12bn.
- At its peak in October 2021, the crypto lender reportedly had $25 billion in assets under management.
- But troubles began after investor interest in such high-risk areas dropped off following the collapse of the TerraUSD “stablecoin” in early May, which along with the Luna coin, was linked to a similar high-yield scheme.
