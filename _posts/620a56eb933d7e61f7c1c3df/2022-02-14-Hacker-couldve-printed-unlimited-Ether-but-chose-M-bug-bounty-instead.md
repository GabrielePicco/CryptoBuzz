A hacker recently discovered an infinite Ether bug in scaling solution Optimism which could've wreaked havoc across the crypto ecosystem.

## Highlights

- A hacker found a glitch in Optimism's code that forces smart contracts to delete themselves and return related Ether to the sender.
- Optimism allows users to send small amounts of crypto with little transactions fees.
- The solution is a potential “layer 2” (L2) solution for scaling Ether.
- The glitch could be exploited to trick smart contracts into looping through the glitch, thus minting infinite “lay-2” crypto.
- Hacker Jay Freeman reported the issue to Optimism’s dev team, who paid him a $2-million bug bounty.
- Freeman says the bug could wreak havoc across the wider crypto ecosystem.
