Oxford quantum physicist Nikita Gourianov is likening the emergence of qantum computers to a financial bubble in a commentary piece for the Financial Times.

## Highlights

- Oxford quantum physicist Nikita Gourianov tore into the quantum computing industry in a Financial Times op-ed piece.
- He likens the "fanfare" around quantum computing to a financial bubble, likening it to the financial boom.
- Despite billions of dollars being poured into quantum computing, he argues, the industry has yet to develop a single product that's actually capable of solving practical problems.
- The piece comes just weeks after a group of researchers found that a conventional computer was able to rival Google's Sycamore quantum computer, undermining the tech giant's 2019 claims of having achieved "quantum supremacy" The piece also took aim at other assumptions, arguing that fears over quantum computers being able to crack even the securest of cryptographic schemes are overblown.
