The congressman did not mince words when blaming Sam Bankman-Fried and SEC Chair Gary Gensler for the industry's current state.

## Highlights

- Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer took both former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and SEC Chair Gary Gensler to task for the collapse of FTX.
- Emmer said the collapse was a failure of business ethics, government oversight, and regulatory procedures.
- FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11, 2022, and several regulators began circling, opening investigations in the troubled cryptocurrency exchange.
- The Ontario Teacher Pension Fund had over $95 million invested and stuck in FTX; the investment represents 0.05% of its total net assets and will have a "limited impact" on the plan, the organization said Tuesday night.
- The congressman reiterated his belief that the issue was not with cryptocurrency or decentralized finance.
