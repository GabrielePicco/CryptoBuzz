Coinbase is leveraging its status as the lone public crypto exchange in a do-or-die play to increase market share across Europe. Without a steady stream of new users, the company may not survive.

## Highlights

- In 2021, Crypto.com spent roughly $2.5 million on advertising in the U.K., while Coinbase spent just 5% of that.
- Without a steady stream of new users, the company may not survive in Europe.
- The company declined to disclose how much it would spend on advertising for its latest Europe push, but regulations on crypto advertising make it difficult to plan advertising campaigns in some European markets like the EU, which is not part of the EU.
- It is leveraging its status as the lone public public crypto exchange in a do-or-die play to increase market share across Europe, according to Sensor Tower and other market intelligence.
