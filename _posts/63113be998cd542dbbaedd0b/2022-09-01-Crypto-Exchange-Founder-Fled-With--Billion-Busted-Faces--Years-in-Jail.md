Turkish crypto exchange founder who absconded with $2 billion last year caught, now faces 40,000 years of jail time.

## Highlights

- Faruk Fatih Özer, founder of Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, has been arrested in Albania.
- Özer allegedly fled the country in April 2021 with about $2 billion that belonged to around 400,000 clients.
- He and other executives of the ill-fated exchange are now facing 40,564 years of jail time for each.
- The identity of Özer was confirmed using biometric results.
- Before abandoning operations abruptly in the spring of 2021, he had worked since 2017 and had about 700,000 client clients in Turkey, where cryptocurrencies have been widely used to protect investments as the national currency lira has been in a secular decline.
