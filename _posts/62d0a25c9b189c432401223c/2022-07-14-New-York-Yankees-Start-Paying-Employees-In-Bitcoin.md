## Highlights

- The New York Yankees MLB team has partnered with Bitcoin fintech NYDIG to enable its employees to be paid in bitcoin.
- The Yankees will become the first MLB team to pay its employees in bitcoin with no transaction fees.
- The Bitcoin Savings Plan (BSP) allows employees of organizations like the Yankees to elect a certain amount of their post-tax salary to be converted into bitcoin.
- While users can sell bitcoin on the platform, BTC cannot be deposited from an external source to the platform or transferred to an external wallet.
- This is the first time the Yankees have partnered with a Bitcoin-only financial services firm that offers infrastructure for companies looking to operate within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
