Tether launching GBPT will make it the company's fourth stablecoin after its market-leading USDT as well as its Chinese and Mexican varaints.

## Highlights

- Tether is launching a new stablecoin pegged to the British pound sterling called GBPT.
- GBPT will be a stable digital currency pegged on the 1:1 ratio to the GBPT, aiming to provide a faster and cheaper option for asset transfers.
- The announcement comes amid the companyâ€™s main stablecoin, USDT, dropping below $70 billion in terms of market capitalisation for the first time since October 2021.
- HM Treasury has said it plans to make the country a global cryptocurrency hub and bring stablecoins into its regulatory framework to include stablecoins as a means of payment.
- The company will launch GBPT in early July and will initially be supported by the Ethereum blockchain.
