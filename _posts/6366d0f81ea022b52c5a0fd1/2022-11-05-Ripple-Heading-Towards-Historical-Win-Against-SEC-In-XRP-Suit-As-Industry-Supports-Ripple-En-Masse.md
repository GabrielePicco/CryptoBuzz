In the XRP vs SEC case, these briefs all collectively support Ripple’s previous notations that the SEC has in fact, been unjust in its dealing

## Highlights

- Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has revealed that 12 amici briefs have been submitted in the Ripple vs SEC case.
- This follows the court granting the SEC motion to extend the time for all parties to file reply briefs.
- The court solely decides whether it is or isn’t worth considering considering the case.
- In the XRP case, these briefs all collectively support Ripple’s previous notations that the SEC has, in fact, been unjust in its dealing with the firm.
- It goes even further to explain, in detail, how many more digital currencies are at risk of being blacklisted by the SEC, especially if it wins its case against Ripple.
