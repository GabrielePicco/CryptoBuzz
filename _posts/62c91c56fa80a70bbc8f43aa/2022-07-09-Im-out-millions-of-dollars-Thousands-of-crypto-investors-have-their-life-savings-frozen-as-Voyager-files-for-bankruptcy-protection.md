“You know, it's embarrassing,\" well-known crypto podcaster Scott Melker tells Fortune. \"I'm a person who talks about risk management and protecting your assets, but I was arguably, in hindsight, overexposed.\"

## Highlights

- Voyager Digital has suspended trading on July 1 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
- The company blamed defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) for its troubles.
- Voyager is trying to restructure and not liquidate, meaning it hopes to return at least a percentage of its customers’ investments.
- In court filings, Voyager may potentially offer shares or tokens in its reorganized company to customers post-bankruptcy.
- As they await next steps, some users have even shared thoughts of suicide and depression online as they wait for next steps.
- “Every day, honestly, I cry,” Robert says.
