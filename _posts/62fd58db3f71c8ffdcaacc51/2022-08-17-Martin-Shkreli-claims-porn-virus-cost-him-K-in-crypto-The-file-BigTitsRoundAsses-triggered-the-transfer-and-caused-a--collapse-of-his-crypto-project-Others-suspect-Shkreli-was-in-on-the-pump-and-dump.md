A suspicious dump of Shkreli's newly created crypto token may have been the result of malware disguised as porn.

## Highlights

- Martin Shkreli has been tied to an early token dump for the cryptocurrency that was supposedly powering the Druglike project.
- The token, $MSI, dropped 90 percent in value after a crypto wallet connected to the disgraced businessman dumped its holdings in exchange for 239 ETH, or a little over $450,000.
- After YouTuber Muta Anas posted a video calling out the hacker for being hacked, the hacker group was able to use a remote trojan to gain access to his personal information, including the keys to his crypto wallet.
- It's possible there's more to the story to blame for the suspicious token dump, but it's also possible there’s more.
