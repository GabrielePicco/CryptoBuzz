Non-executive directors hired in the wake of the crypto exchange’s collapse are earning $50,000 a month – but the fees may pale in comparison to the overall costs of corporate restructuring.

## Highlights

- FTX is still having trouble identifying who was on its payroll, complicating efforts to pay out as much as $1,000,000 in back pay.
- Ray has previously criticized practices such as purchasing Bahamas real estate for staff using company funds.
- Non-executive directors hired in the wake of the collapse are earning $50,000 a month, but the fees may pale in comparison to the overall costs of corporate restructuring.
- FTX has also criticized practices as the worst he’s ever seen in his 40-year restructuring career, including for the failed energy company Enron, which collapsed in 2007, and has since been forced to pay back $3,500,000 to staff.
