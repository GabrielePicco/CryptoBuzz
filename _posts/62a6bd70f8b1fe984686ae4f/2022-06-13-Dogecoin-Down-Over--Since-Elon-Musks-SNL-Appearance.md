Now valued at around $0.06, the value of the meme coin has continued to plummet despite persistent invocation by the Tesla founder.

## Highlights

- Dogecoin's fan base hoped that Elon Musk's appearance on "Saturday Night Live" would shoot the joke coin's value "over the moon" A year later, the coin remains on a downward spiral, down almost 91% since Musk’s appearance on May 8, 2021.
- The coin began to plummet in value in real time as the show aired, shedding over 20% of its value in a single hour.
- DogeCoin is widely considered to be the first ‘meme coin,’ created as a joke in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Marcus to poke fun at the plethora of altcoins flooding the market.
- The joke coin soon attracted the interest of billionaire Elon Musk, who began tweeting about the coin.
