Crypto lender BlockFi is struggling to raise cash despite offering to take a steep discount on its valuation, The Post has learned.

## Highlights

- Crypto lender BlockFi is struggling to raise cash despite offering to take a steep discount on its valuation, The Post has learned.
- The Jersey City, NJ based startup raised $400 million in a funding round that valued the company at $5 billion last fall.
- The firm has for at least a month been trying to raise $100 million at a valuation of just $1 billion â€” a haircut that amounts to 80% over half a year.
- Sources say investors have grown increasingly concerned the firm could soon end up like crypto lender Celsius Network, which this week hired restructuring advisors after freezing all withdrawals, swaps and transfers last week because of market volatility, a source close to the situation said.
