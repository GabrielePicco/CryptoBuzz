For years, Wasabi claimed its Bitcoin mixing service was private and untraceable. But Chainalysis can track funds with simple techniques.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin wallet Wasabi failed to follow the aptly named protocol ZeroLink.
- Chainalysis traced the source of certain users’ funds all the way through Wasabi’s mixer.
- Wallet's mixing algorithm was partially deterministic, not truly random.
- Wallet developer LaurentMT said Wasabi ‘dropped the ball” by not implementing ZeroLink, which requires “zero linking” of mixed and unmixed Bitcoin.
- Wallet users are competing to provide the most privacy for Bitcoin users in the world.
- Wallet developers Samourai Wallet and Bitcoin Lightning nodes compete over which can provide privacy for users.
