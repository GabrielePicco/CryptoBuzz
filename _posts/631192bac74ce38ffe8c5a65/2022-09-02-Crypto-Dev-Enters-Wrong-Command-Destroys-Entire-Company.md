A programming error accidentally — and permanently — shut down the entire Solana blockchain-based platform OptiFi, wiping out $661,000 worth of USDC.

## Highlights

- A programming error shut down the Solana blockchain-based platform OptiFi, wiping out $661,000 worth of a stablecoin called USDC.
- The company says one of its developers accidentally used a command that shut the whole thing down in one fell swoop.
- That means over half a million dollars worth of USDC are now "not recoverable at the moment of writing" The company has some words of advice: "Please don't rush like what we did, especially for DeFi projects," the company wrote in a blog post.
- "We will compensate all users’ funds and prevent it from happening again," it said.
- It's a massive and expensive oversight that illustrates the risks of carrying out financial transactions without any intermediary authorities.
