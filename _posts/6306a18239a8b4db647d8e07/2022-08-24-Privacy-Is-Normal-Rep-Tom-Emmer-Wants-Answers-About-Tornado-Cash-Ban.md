The Treasury’s recent ban on Ethereum mixing service Tornado Cash has a U.S. Representative asking tough questions.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Congressman Tom Emmer has written a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
- Tornado Cash, a smart contract-powered coin mixing tool, was recently banned by the Treasury.
- The move was deeply controversial in the crypto space, and now a congressman has questioned the Treasury Department's decision.
- OFAC claimed that Tornado Cash had been used to “launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019” But that figure may be inaccurate, as most of it has been used for legitimate reasons, with only $1.5 billion associated with crime or money laundering, according to crypto analytics firm Elliptic.
