title:  "Porn actress Lana Rhoades apparently abandons her NFT project after its launch."
description: "Lana Rhoades put her celebrity status behind the \"CryptoSis\" NFT project, which launched on January 22 and raised about $1.8 million. The project featured a detailed roadmap, explaining plans to develop metaverse wearables and a \"hangout spot\", send personalized messages from Rhoades to a small group of holders, and send out merchandise. The website also promised \"real world utilities\" including meet and greets with the \"many mainstream notable female figures [who] will continue to join this community\".However, only weeks after launch, Rhoades appeared to have abandoned the project, and most of the funds had been transferred out. Rhoades deleted her TikTok videos in which she had promoted it, and didn't respond to tweets asking about the project. One community member wrote on Discord that they had \"spent what [they] can't lose. Spent 4k, on total I had 6k. Man I'm left with 2k only. No job and have a 2 yo son\". Hopefully the guy who got the tattoo of the project logo on his shin also isn't too disappointed... The NFTs, which cost 0.1 ETH each to mint (about $250), were selling for around 0.005 ETH (about $15) on February 16, if they were being bought at all."
