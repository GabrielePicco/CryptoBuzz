A massive whale is moving more than a billion dollars in Bitcoin in a flurry of transactions that effectively emptied a number of newly created crypto wallets.

## Highlights

- A massive whale is moving more than a billion dollars in Bitcoin in a flurry of transactions that effectively emptied a number of newly created crypto wallets.
- The deep-pocketed investor just drained a crypto wallet that had recently accumulated over 74,105 in BTC worth over $1.58 billion.
- The wealthy Bitcoin whale initially shifted the large BTC trove in two transactions.
- The first transfer involves the movement of 50,562 BTC, worth nearly $1 billion at time of writing, to a wallet of unknown origin.
- For the second transfer, the whale moved 23,542 BTC worth about $505 million to a separate wallet.
- The total number of the shifted Bitcoin is slightly higher than the BTC that was initially transferred, suggesting that the entity behind the movements may have mixed in a few BTC
