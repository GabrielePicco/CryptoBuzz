Several huge crypto wallets have simultaneously sent millions of dollars worth of Solana (SOL) to Coinbase in a flurry of transactions.

## Highlights

- Several huge crypto wallets have simultaneously sent millions of dollars worth of Solana (SOL) to Coinbase in a flurry of transactions.
- The series of whale transfers was initially detected by blockchain tracker and analytics tool Whale Alert.
- It cost virtually nothing in fees to process all five transactions amounting to 2,954,427 SOL worth nearly $70 million.
- SOL is trading for $20.83 at time of writing, a fractional increase in the last 24 hours.
- The transactions happened in less than two minutes with relatively similar amounts, which indicates a single entity could be behind the transfers.
- Since the crypto assets were all sent to a crypto exchange, they could potentially be sold on the open market.
