Bitcoin lines up a grim weekly close as BTC price action circles $27,000 and Ethereum gives up its realized price.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) saw further losses on June 12 as thin weekend trading volumes fueled an ongoing sell-off.
- Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting lows of $27,150 on its sixth straight day of downside.
- The pair was in danger of resuming the losing streak, which had previously seen a record nine weeks of red candles in a row.
- To avoid that outcome and put in a second “green” close, Bitcoin/USD needed to gain over $2,000 from current spot price, which at the time of writing was $28,400.
- Analysts fear a retest of May’s ten-month lows was due.
