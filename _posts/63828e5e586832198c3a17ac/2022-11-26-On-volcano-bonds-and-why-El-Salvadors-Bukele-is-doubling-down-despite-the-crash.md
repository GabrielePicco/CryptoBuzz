El Salvador was the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. It has lost millions and risks default, but it won't change course.

## Highlights

- El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele pledged to buy one Bitcoin every day going forward.
- The policy has stalled El Salvador’s negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $1.3 billion loan, needed to plug big gaps in its public finances.
- The government has been courting alternative sources of cash, announcing new trade talks with China on Nov.
- 9.
- But few economists believe that China is willing to help El Salvador with the all-time-high $21 billion debt burden it owes to foreign lenders.
- Salvadorans just aren’t that into Bitcoin: an in-person survey of 1,269 residents in October found that less than a quarter of respondents had used the cryptocurrency in 2022.
