Ethereum's Merge event has a new launch date after network developers laid out a fresh timeline for testnets and updates.

## Highlights

- Members of the Ethereum community have set their sights on a new date for the blockchain's long-awaited Merge.
- The network is expected to merge from its current state as a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to an energy-efficient proof of-stake (PoS) network.
- The Merge event planned for September will effectively move Ethereum activity over to the Beacon Chain, which launched in December 2020, marking the beginning of a multi-stage upgrade.
- Goerli, the last public testnet to run through the merge transition, should do so around August 11th.
- The merge event will also be a final trial on the last Ethereum testnet, which also trialed a similar merge last week.
