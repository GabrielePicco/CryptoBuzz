Assuming the long-dormant coins—worth $8 in 2012—were sold, the unknown owner reaped a 120,000,000% profit.

## Highlights

- An ancient Bitcoin address that has not transacted in over a decade came back to life on Wednesday.
- Since October 1 2012, address 1MMXRA held 412.12 BTC accumulated across four transactions, altogether worth just $8 at the time.
- By today’s prices, the moved coins represent $9.6 million in value–a 120,000,000% profit.
- Nobody knows whether Satoshi Nakamoto has ever touched those coins, or if he still interacts with them today.
- Satoshi is suspected of holding as much as 5% of Bitcoin's entire supply due to mining in network's early days, but many don’t believe those coins will ever move again.
