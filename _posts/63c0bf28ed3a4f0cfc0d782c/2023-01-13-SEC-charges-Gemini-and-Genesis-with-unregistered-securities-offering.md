The program has been the subject of a public fight between the two erstwhile corporate partners.

## Highlights

- SEC charges Genesis Global Capital LLC and Gemini Trust Company LLC for the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through a Gemini crypto lending program.
- The program has been the subject of a public fight between the two erstwhile corporate partners.
- Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss blasted Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group, accusing Genesisâ€™s former lending partner of defrauding thousands of Earn users and misleading them regarding DCG's solvency.
- The SEC says Genesis and Gemini entered into an agreement in December 2020 with Gemini customers an opportunity to loan their crypto to Genesis in exchange for Genesis' promise to pay interest.
- Genesis said it would not allow its Gemini Earn investors to withdraw their crypto because Genesis lacked sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests.
