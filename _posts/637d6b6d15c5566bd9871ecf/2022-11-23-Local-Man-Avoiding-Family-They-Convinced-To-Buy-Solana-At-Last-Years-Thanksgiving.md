## Highlights

- Tyler Sterling advises his near-retirement aged relatives to ‘go all in’ on Solana.
- Tyler maintains that he doesn’t regret advising people on the verge of retirement to invest in a web3 project that’s experienced so many public blunders.
- Tyler claims to have made amends with his family, having since convinced them to go all in on Loopring in a final hail-mary to recoup their losses.
- The 23-year-old delivery driver has since convinced his family to invest more in Solana and Loopring.
- He says he still thinks that Uncle Rico is overreacting – if he lives a few more years then he’ll probably be able to break even during the next bull run
