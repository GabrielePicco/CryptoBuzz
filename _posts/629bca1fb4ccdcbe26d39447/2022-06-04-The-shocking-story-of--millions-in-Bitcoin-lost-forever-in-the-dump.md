description: "There have been a number of exciting stories in the Bitcoin world this week, but none more so than the story of James Howells. Howells is an IT specialist who mined 7,500 bitcoins back in 2009, when they were worth next to nothing. Fast forward to today and that stash of digital currency would be worth $500 million dollars. But sadly for Howells, he threw away his hard drives without any back up - meaning he's lost in eternity."

There have been a number of exciting stories in the Bitcoin world this week, but none more so than the story of James Howells. Howells is an IT specialist who mined 7,500 bitcoins back in 2009, when they were worth next to nothing. Fast forward to today and that stash of digital currency would be worth $500 million dollars. But sadly for Howells, he threw away his hard drives without any back up - meaning he's lost in eternity.

## Highlights

- James Howells accidentally dumped 7,500 bitcoins while cleaning up his computer in 2013.
- At the time, each Bitcoin was worth around $130, so the total value of the coins was around $975,000.
- He realized he had dumped the hard drive when the price of bitcoin started to rise in 2013, but he was unable to find it.
- Howells is now seeking to excavate the landfill where he allegedly dumped it in order to find his hard drive.
- The council has refused to allow Howells to search for the drive, which is buried under four feet of rubbish in a landfill site in Wales.
- However, the process will be very difficult and expensive, and there is no guarantee it will be found.
