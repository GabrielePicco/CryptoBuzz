Crypto and privacy advocate Edward Snowden said the U.S. government sanctioning Tornado Cash created a \"do or die moment\" for crypto.

## Highlights

- Edward Snowden says the U.S.
- government sanctioned Tornado Cash is a "do or die moment" for crypto.
- Tornado Cash allows users pool and "mix" coins to mask the origin and destination of their transactions.
- Snowden: "It doesn't do anything unless you push it, but it's a very simple thing.
- The suggestion that this is a bad thing is much less the kind of thing that merits granting the government a new and largely unlimited sanctions authority—to say nothing of kicking in the door and like imprisoning the poor bastard who was decent enough to build this in the park in the first place for us to benefit from—that is deeply illiberal and profoundly authoritarian"
