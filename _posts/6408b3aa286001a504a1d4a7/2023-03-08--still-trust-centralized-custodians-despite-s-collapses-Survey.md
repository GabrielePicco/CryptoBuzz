An annual survey from crypto firm Paxos has found the majority of United States crypto owners still trust intermediaries to hold their crypto.

## Highlights

- Paxos annual survey finds majority of U.S.
- crypto hodlers still trust banks, exchanges and mobile payment apps to custody their assets.
- 75% of respondents indicated they were “likely or very likely” to purchase crypto from their “primary bank” if it were offered, a 12 percentage point increase from the year before.
- The survey also found more desire to be able to buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and other digital assets from household or traditional banks.
- It said a “significant untapped opportunity” existed for banks if they expanded offerings to digital assets, adding 45% said they would be encouraged to invest more in crypto if there was more mainstream adoption by banks.
