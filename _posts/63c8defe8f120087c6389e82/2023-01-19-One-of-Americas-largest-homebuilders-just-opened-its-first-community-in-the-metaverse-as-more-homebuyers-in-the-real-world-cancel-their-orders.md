KB Homes designed a metaverse community to promote \"exploration and engagement\" among its customers as its cancellation rate grew to 68% in Q4 2022.

## Highlights

- LA-based builder KB Home opened a first-of-its-kind community in the metaverse on January 17.
- The company's CEO said the community is meant to inspire "exploration and engagement" among its customers.
- The move comes just days after the company announced in its fourth quarter earnings that its cancellation rate has risen to 68% compared to just 13% it reported in Q4 2021.
- KB Home's virtual community allows customers to personalize some of the company's model homes to their preferences, from changing the architectural style to customizing the interior design.
- It was designed in partnership with marketing firm The Metaverse Group and launched on the Decentraland platform.
