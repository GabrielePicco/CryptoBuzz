Through the bill, the senator seeks to provide prosecutors with a clear legal framework against crypto crimes that align with the spirit of the blockchain while combatting fraud.

## Highlights

- New York State Senator Kevin Thomas introduced a new bill amendment request to establish certain offenses related to rug pulls and other frauds related to virtual token distribution, misuse of private keys and hidden interests in crypto projects.
- The bill calls for a law amendment that will imply rug pull charges on developers that sell “more than 10% of such tokens within five years from the date of last sale” The bill also seeks to charge developers with fraudulent failure to disclose interest in virtual tokens that don’t publicly disclose personal crypto holdings on the landing page of the primary website.
- Two members of the House of Representatives recently introduced legislation to mitigate financial risks tied to El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender.
