MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-loving chairman said that concerns over Bitcoin’s energy consumption are nothing but a talking point from the Proof of Stake (POS) crypto lobby.

## Highlights

- MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has published a letter clearing his thoughts on Bitcoin mining and its impact on the environment and energy systems.
- He argued that Bitcoin mining is, in reality, far less of an environmental issue than it is often made out to be.
- The Bitcoin network currently consumes more energy than any other blockchain network by a wide margin.
- The only network of comparable size using this mechanism is.
- However, with the Merge expected to happen within the next 24 hours, Bitcoin will soon stand alone as the only cryptocurrency with a noteworthy energy profile.
- Saylor said he was motivated to “share the truth” given the “misinformation & propaganda” circulating about Bitcoin.
