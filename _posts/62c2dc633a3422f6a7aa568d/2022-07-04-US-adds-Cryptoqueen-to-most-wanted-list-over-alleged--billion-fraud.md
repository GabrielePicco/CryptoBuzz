A German citizen accused of defrauding investors out of $4 billion by selling a fake cryptocurrency called OneCoin has been added to the FBI's list of its ten most-wanted fugitives, U.S. officials said on Thursday.

## Highlights

- Ruja Ignatova, also known as "Cryptoqueen," was charged in 2019 with eight counts including wire fraud and securities fraud for running the Bulgaria-based OneCoin Ltd as a pyramid scheme.
- Prosecutors say the company offered commissions for members to entice others to buy a worthless cryptocurrency.
- The FBI adds fugitives to its most-wanted list when it believes the public may be able to assist with tracking suspects down.
- "She timed her scheme perfectly, capitalizing on the frenzied speculation of the early days of cryptocurrency," says Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.
- He described OneCoin as "one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history"
