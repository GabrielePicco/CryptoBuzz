The finding further helps Bitcoin distance itself from those previously claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto.

## Highlights

- Historical data of domain name purchases suggest that Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin (BTC), had an alternate naming option in mind that did not make it to the whitepaper.
- Bitcoin.org, the website domain linked to the original Bitcoin, was created on Aug.
- 18, 2008, under AnonymousSpeech, a service in Japan that allowed users to buy domain names anonymously.
- The finding further helps Bitcoin distance itself from those that have previously claimed to be the founder of Bitcoin.
- The decision to stick with Bitcoin may have been crucial to its success due to the fact that numerous members of the crypto community highlighted their dislike for the name Netcoin.org.
