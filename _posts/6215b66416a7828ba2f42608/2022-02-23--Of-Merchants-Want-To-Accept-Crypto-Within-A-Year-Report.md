The survey finds a massive disparity between merchants currently accepting crypto, and the number that would like to start doing so in 2022.

## Highlights

- Worldpay from FIS – a top global fintech provider – recently released a joint report with Crypto.com covering attitudes around cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange.
- It found huge interest among both merchants and customers in using cryptocurrencies to transact in 2022.
- By contrast, 60% of both customers and merchants showed interest in using/ accepting crypto this year.
- However, real adoption is likely to be much slower than that.
- The steep learning curve and complexities of coordinating these new payment systems among internal teams will prove burdensome challenges for institutions.
- Merchants may be hesitant to sell their products for these assets for fear that their value may drop substantially the next day.
