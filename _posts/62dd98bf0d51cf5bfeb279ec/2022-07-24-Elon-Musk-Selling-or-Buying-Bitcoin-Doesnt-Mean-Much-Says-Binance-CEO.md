CZ Zhao joked that he was not smart enough to get into businesses directly linked to bankrupted lending firms like Celsius and Voyager.

## Highlights

- Binance CEO CZ Zhao does not think anyone selling or buying Bitcoin can fundamentally impact the asset.
- Tesla CEO Elon Musk dumped 75% of its bitcoin holdings in Q2.
- CZ said he is still holding most of the coins he bought when he just entered the industry.
- Zhao said he has no fiat, and all he has is crypto – thus, it is the only asset he uses for purchases in life.
- He also said Binance has “very minimal exposure” to collapsed lending firms like Celsius and Voyager, adding that the exchange acted as neither creditor nor debtor.
- He once put forth $500 million to support Elon Musk’s ambition to acquire Twitter.
