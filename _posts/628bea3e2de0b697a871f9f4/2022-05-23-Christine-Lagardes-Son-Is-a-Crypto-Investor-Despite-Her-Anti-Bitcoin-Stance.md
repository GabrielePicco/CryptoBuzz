The son of the highly vocal crypto critic has entered the cryptocurrency market, despite her concerns.

## Highlights

- Christine Lagarde has reiterated her negative stance on cryptocurrencies.
- The President of the European Central Bank (ECB) said they are “based on nothing” and should be strictly regulated.
- She said the ECB has plans to introduce a digital euro in the next four years as it will be a much different product than bitcoin.
- Lagarde admitted not owning any cryptocurrencies, explaining, “I want to practice what I preach.” However, it seems that her advice did not stop one of her two sons from diversifying his portfolio with digital assets.
