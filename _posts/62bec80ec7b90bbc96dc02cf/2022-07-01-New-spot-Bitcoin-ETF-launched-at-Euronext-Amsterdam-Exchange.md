## Highlights

- Jacobi Asset Management is preparing to launch its Jacobi Bitcoin ETF on Euronext Amsterdam.
- The spot Bitcoin ETF will start trading on the Amsterdam Exchange next month.
- Jacobi received approval from Guernsey Financial Services Commission to launch the Bitcoin ETF in October 2021.
- Investors buying an exchange-traded Bitcoin product will own the units that own the Bitcoin, founder and CEO Jamie Khurshid told Cointelegraph.
- The fund is not allowed to lend, stake or leverage any of the assets it owns, he said.
- The move is a significant milestone in the global spot crypto ETF market as Amsterdam is associated with Europeâ€™s top sharing trading venue.
