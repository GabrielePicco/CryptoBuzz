CZ says Binance’s full exit from FTT is a response to “recent revelations that have come to light” about FTX.

## Highlights

- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says he's not interested in selling FTX tokens in an OTC deal with Alameda.
- Alameda CEO Caroline Elison publicly offered to purchase all of the FTT Binance intends to offload for $22 a piece on Sunday.
- FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) didn’t take kindly to CZ’s words, saying “a competitor” was targeting his exchange with “false rumors.” CZ denies that his company has been part of any kind of “conspiracy” against FTX, or that he's in a “fight” with FTX.
