Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch its own digital currency.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin banned in Nigeria in 2021, but the more Bitcoin price rises, the more the Nigerian population is tempted to buy it.
- One-fifth and one-third of adults in Nigeria have invested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at least once.
- Nigeria is ranked 11th out of 146 countries this year by Chainalysis for its degree of crypto adoption, which measures its popularity among individuals.
- Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a digital version of its currency, the eNaira, the same year it banned Bitcoin.
- The government wants to make this new currency a tool for financial inclusion for all those who do not have bank accounts, by allowing it to be used with a simple phone.
