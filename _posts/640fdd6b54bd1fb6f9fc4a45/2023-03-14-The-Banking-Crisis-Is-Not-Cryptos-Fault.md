Crypto might have a banking problem, but banks don’t have a crypto problem.

## Highlights

- Signature is viewed as another crypto-friendly bank as Silvergate was.
- Now, on Sunday, we had Signature shut down by state regulators.
- We’ve seen Barney Frank – yes, the Frank in Dodd-Frank – come out and say that clients may have overestimated Signature’s exposure to crypto.
- Frank knows this because, and I cannot believe this is true, he is a board member at Signature.
