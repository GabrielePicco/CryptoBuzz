FatManTerra initially wrote that he’d “received access to a high-yield BTC farm” and said that people could message him if they wanted in on the yield farming opportunity.

## Highlights

- Crypto influencer FatManTerra claims to have gathered over $100,000 worth of Bitcoin from crypto investors in an investment scheme that was later revealed as fake.
- The post was created as an experiment to teach people how easy it is to dupe people in crypto by using simple buzzwords and promising big investment returns.
- FatMan has now refunded all of the money and reiterated that “free lunches don’t exist” The post received a ton of negative responses from people calling it out as a scam, but FatMan said he still managed to raise more than $100k worth of BTC from the initial post within a span of two hours.
