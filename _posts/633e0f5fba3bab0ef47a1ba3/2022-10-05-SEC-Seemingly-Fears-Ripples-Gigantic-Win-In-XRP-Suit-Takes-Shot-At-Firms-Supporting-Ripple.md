The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opposed efforts by two firms to submit amici briefs to court in support of Ripple in the

## Highlights

- SEC has opposed efforts by two firms, I-Remit and TapJets, to submit amici briefs to court in support of Ripple in the $1.3bn XRP securities lawsuit.
- The regulator has lambasted the movants for trying to offer evidence that is outside of the limitations of discovery rules and the court’s prior order.
- Ripple believes these documents will bolster its case and prove that the SEC has picked two winners in the crypto industry — bitcoin and ether — while spurning the rest.
- If the court rules in Ripple's favour, XRP, which has largely been in the doldrums since the lawsuit was filed, stands a chance to explode to new all-time highs.
