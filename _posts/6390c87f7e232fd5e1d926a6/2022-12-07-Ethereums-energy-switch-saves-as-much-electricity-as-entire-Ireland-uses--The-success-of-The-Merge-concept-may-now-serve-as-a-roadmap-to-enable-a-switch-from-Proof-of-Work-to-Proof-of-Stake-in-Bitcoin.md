Ethereum, the world's second-largest crypto asset by market value, has drastically changed its energy usage, resulting in saving a country-size proportion of power consumption.

## Highlights

- The Merge is the result of a switch to Proof of Stake in the world's second-largest crypto asset by market value.
- The decrease in energy use might be enough to meet Austria's or Ireland's national electrical needs.
- The success of The Merge may now serve as a roadmap to enable a switch from Proof of Work to  Bitcoin and other crypto assets still utilizing Proof of work, as per the study.
- However, it would still be premature for the Ethereum community to declare a "complete victory" over the sustainability concerns facing crypto assets, according to the study researchers releasing a statement on September 15, 2022.
