... Or any other institutions for that matter.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin will grant the unbanked and underbanked universal access to basic financial products, but I contend that there will always be money changers.
- I think as much as we love self-sovereignty, a lot of people value the hands-off peace of mind that comes with trusting a third party with at least some of their hard-earned money.
- Or any other institution for that matter.
