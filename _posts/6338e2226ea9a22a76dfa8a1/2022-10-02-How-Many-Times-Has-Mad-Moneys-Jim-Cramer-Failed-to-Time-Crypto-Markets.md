It's been said that \"not all investors have the same investing style.\" But Jim Cramer, with his contrarian strategy, arguably made many people poor. Now he has become a meme for his consistency in making wrong calls on the direction of cryptocurrency markets.

## Highlights

- Jim Cramer has become a meme for his consistency in making wrong calls on the direction of cryptocurrency markets.
- Cramer warned of a possible probe into crypto exchange Coinbase by the U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission.
- The 67-year-old former hedge fund manager has often issued mixed signals regarding crypto markets.
- He bought a significant amount of bitcoin in 2020 when it traded for $12,000.
- He sold 50% of the cache when the price hit $64,000 the following year, and used the proceeds to “pay off a mortgage” Cramer is seen as a so-called contrarian investor who frequently goes against the tide, buying when everyone is selling.
