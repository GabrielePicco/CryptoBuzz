## Highlights

- A new wallet address fraud that targets careless copy pasters is becoming rampant, according to MetaMask.
- Scammers extract the first and last four alpha-numerical combinations in a wallet address and use them to create a fake new address.
- A $0 transaction is then sent from the newly created fake address to replace the matching stored address in your transaction history.
- According to Twitter user Tuzun, over 340,000 addresses have been poisoned since December 2022, fleecing nearly 95 wallets of unsuspecting victims of approximately $1.6 million.
- The total cost of the attacks at a little over $25,000, signalling a profit margin above 6,000%.
