A British 'Tinder swindler' says he can't pay back almost $200K in Bitcoin to the woman he conned because he can't access his wallet.

## Highlights

- Richard Dexter was convicted of fraud, perverting the course of justice and possessing an article for use in fraud in February.
- He promised to pay back the amount he took from Amrita Sebastian "within a day" But two months later, no funds have shown up and he has 28 days to find the keys to his Bitcoin wallet.
- Dexter is the owner of a donut shop called Sticky Boy in Southsea, Portsmouth which opened its doors a month before he received a four-year prison sentence.
- Dexter claimed he had been “locked in a cell for 23 hours a day with no access to telephones or emails” due to COVID-19.
