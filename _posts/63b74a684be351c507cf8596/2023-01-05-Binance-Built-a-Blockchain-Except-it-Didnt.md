For all its limitations, blockchain technology does provide some distinct advantages, one of which is a canonically accurate and immutable record of all historical transactions which have occurred up…

## Highlights

- Binance runs two “blockchains” that are not just highly centralized, but regularly alter history, undermining one of the core tenets of the blockchain — immutability.
- Binance Chain was built to allow users to develop decentralized applications on top of its blockchain, its primary purpose was the decentralized trading of cryptocurrencies to support the Binance DEX exchange.
- In reality developers couldn’t really build very much on the blockchain because it was based on the Cosmos blockchain framework.
- The Cosmos SDK (software development kit) is an open source toolkit built for developers to create single-purpose blockchains, in the case of Binance.
