NFT marketplace major OpenSea announced layoffs on Thursday.

## Highlights

- CEO Devin Finzer says roughly 20% of the team is being let go.
- The exact number of employees impacted wasn't disclosed.
- OpenSea later told The Block that 230 employees remain at the company.
- According to The Block's Data Dashboard, volumes across NFT markets have fallen sharply since the highs seen earlier this year.
- The company says it plans to maintain multiple years of runway under various crypto winter scenarios (5 years at the current volume), and give us high confidence that we will only have to go through this process once," Finzer said in a statement posted to the social media site's Twitter account.
