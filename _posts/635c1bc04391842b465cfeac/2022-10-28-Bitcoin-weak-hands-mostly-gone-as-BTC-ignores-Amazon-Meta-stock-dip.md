Bitcoin refuses to copy tech stocks in dropping hard as BTC price consolidates.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin dropped around $800 over Oct.
- 27, or 3.8%, after hitting its highest levels in six weeks.
- Amazon's market cap dropped 20% in Q3 following missed earnings targets.
- Amazonâ€™s comedown notably failed to spark copycat moves on crypto markets.
- Bitcoin was still around $20,200 at the time of writing, offering more consolidatory trading behavior than a major correction.
- The observation feeds into a growing narrative over Bitcoin's correlation to traditional markets.
