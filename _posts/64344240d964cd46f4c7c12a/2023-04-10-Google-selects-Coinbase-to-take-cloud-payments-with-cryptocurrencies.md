By lining up a broad deal with Coinbase, Google might pick up an edge against Amazon and Microsoft by letting clients pay with Bitcoin or other digital coins.

## Highlights

- Google's cloud division will let some customers pay for cloud services with Bitcoin or other digital coins.
- Google Cloud Platform will initially accept cryptocurrency payments from a handful of customers in the Web3 world.
- The deal might succeed in luring cutting-edge companies to Google in a fierce, fast-growing market.
- The cloud business now accounts for 9% of revenue, up from less than 6% three years ago, as it is expanding more quickly than Alphabet as a whole.
- Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum and Litecoin prices have all declined over 60% in the past year, but the stock is still down over 70% for the year.
