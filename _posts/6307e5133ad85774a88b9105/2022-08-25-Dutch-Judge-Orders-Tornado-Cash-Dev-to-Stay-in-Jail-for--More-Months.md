The Tornado Cash developer has been ordered to stay in holding for another 90 days. It's still unclear what he has been charged with.

## Highlights

- Alexey Pertsev was arrested in Amsterdam on August 10 over suspected money laundering charges.
- He was denied bail after being held in pre-trial holding for up to 110 days, during which charges and an initial public hearing must be set.
- Tornado Cash is an open-sourced privacy protocol that hides any identifiable information about crypto transactions.
- The U.S.
- Treasury has sanctioned the app, with suspicious links to North Korean state hacker group Lazarus Group, as well as allegedly being involved with laundering $7 billion since 2019.
- The community has been quick to take action, with a Change.org petition circulating and a protest on Sunday in Amsterdam to support the developer.
