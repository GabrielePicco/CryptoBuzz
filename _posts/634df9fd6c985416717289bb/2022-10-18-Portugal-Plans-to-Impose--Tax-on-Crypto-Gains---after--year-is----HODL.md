Portugal may lose its status as a tax haven for crypto investors next year, as the government has proposed a 28% capital gains tax on crypto.

## Highlights

- Portugal has proposed a new cryptocurrency tax policy that would take effect as part of its 2023 national budget.
- The proposal intends to treat crypto as equal to other industries and to establish a clear framework for crypto taxation.
- Portugal is home to what some call ‘Bitcoin Beach’ in Meia Praia, an unofficial gathering place for crypto fanatics who relocated to avoid taxes in Italy and France.
- Portugal saw a massive 40% increase in immigration from 2011 to 2021, according to data from the European Commission.
- It remains to be seen how the new policies will affect Portugal’s crypto economy and if it will face an exodus, like India.
