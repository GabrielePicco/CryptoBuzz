ETH/BTC eyes breakout that could be similar to what Dow Jones Industrial Average underwent after the Great Depression.

## Highlights

- ETH/BTC has been forming an inverse-cup-and-handle pattern since May 2021 on the weekly chart.
- The pattern is a bearish reversal pattern, accompanied by lower trading volume.
- It typically resolves after the price breaks below its support level, followed by a fall toward the level at a length equal to the maximum height between the cup's peak and the support line.
- A rally toward 0.5 BTC in 2023 is on the table, up more than 520% from current price levels.
- The pair awaits a breakout move above the pattern's resistance level of 0.08 BTC, eyeing a pullback toward its lower trendline at around 0.05 BTC.
