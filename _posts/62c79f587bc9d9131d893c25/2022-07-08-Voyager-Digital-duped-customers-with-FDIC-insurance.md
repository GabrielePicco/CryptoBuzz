Customers are considering filing fraud claims with their bank over Voyager and its chief Stephen Ehrlich's false insurance advertising.

## Highlights

- Toronto-based Voyager Digital has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to halt a “run on the bank” CEO Stephen Ehrlich estimates that the company owes money to a stunning 100,000 creditors.
- The firm’s equity (USD$49 million market cap) is trading lower than its crypto token VGX ($59m market cap).VGX is subordinate to equity, confers no voting rights, and enjoys no investor nor consumer protection oversight.
- Voyager's marketing led customers to believe FDIC insurance would protect their assets in the case of the company collapsing.
- Allegations of complex financial relationships led to rumors that Sam Bankman-Fried might lose no money due to Voyager's collapse.
