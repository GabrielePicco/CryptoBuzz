Chinese protesters demanding bank deposits tussle with security men

## Highlights

- Banks froze millions of dollars worth of deposits in April, telling customers they were upgrading their internal systems.
- Chinese media has reported that the frozen deposits could be worth up to $1.5 billion and authorities are investigating the three banks.
- About 1,000 people gathered outside the Zhengzhou branch of China's central bank on Sunday to demand action.
- The banks have not issued any communication on the matter since, depositors said.
- None of the banks has responded to emails and telephone calls seeking comment.
- The banks, which include the Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank and the Shangcai Huimin Country Bank, are under investigation by the authorities for illegal fundraising.
