Small Bitcoin holders have grown steadily over time at the expense of whales – especially after the collapse of FTX.

## Highlights

- Nearly 1 million Bitcoin addresses now hold over 1 BTC, much of which was accumulated between 2021 and 2023.
- Small Bitcoin holders have grown steadily over time at the expense of whales, data shows.
- Bitcoin’s long entrenchment under $24,000 provided ample opportunity for smaller holders to increase their position sizes.
- Smaller Bitcoin holders added a record 96.2k BTC to their collective holdings within the month since FTX’�s collapse in November.
- Only about 11% of Bitcoin's supply is held by entities with greater than 0.1% of all holdings.
- Meanwhile, the number of addresses holding >0.1 BTC and >100 BTC has remained relatively flat since at least 2018.
