A situation that could add downward pressure to the price of Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin has fallen back below $30K, and now below $20K, Bitcoin miners are facing a loss of income.
- Some mining companies have placed their mining equipment as collateral to obtain loans from specialized companies.
- The price of their equipment would have fallen below the outstanding principal on their loans.
- This represents a “potential risk to major cryptocurrency lenders,” Bloomberg considers.
- A shakeout in the industry could be imminent, especially for small operators who bought expensive equipment several months ago, thinking it would increase in value.
- This will be an opportunity for the most powerful Bitcoin miners to strengthen their market share in the Bitcoin Hash Rate by buying back mining equipment at a reduced price.
