FTX's new CEO John Ray III oversaw the liquidation of Enron and said: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls.\"

## Highlights

- FTX CEO John Ray III oversaw the liquidation of Enron and said: "Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls" Bankruptcy filings show the fair value of crypto held by FTX is $659,000.
- That compares to claims from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's that the company held $5.5 billion in "less liquid" crypto tokens.
- FTX's assets as of September 30 total about $2.2 billion, according to the bankruptcy filing, though its unclear how different those numbers might be today given the recent run on the exchange and high-profile hacks.
