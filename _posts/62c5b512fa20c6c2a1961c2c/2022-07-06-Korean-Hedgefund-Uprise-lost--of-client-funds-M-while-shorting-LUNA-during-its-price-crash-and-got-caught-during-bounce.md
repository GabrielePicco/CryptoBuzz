Korean startup Uprise lost $20 million in client funds by shorting Luna during its price collapse — and getting caught on the bounces.

## Highlights

- Korean crypto startup Uprise lost virtually all of its client funds by shorting luna (LUNA) during its price crash and getting caught on the bounces.
- The Korean firm billed itself as using artificial intelligence (AI-enabled automatic trading strategies) to trade crypto on behalf of its clients.
- The firm also reportedly lost $3 million of its own funds short trading LUNA.
- Uprise is the latest crypto business to be impacted by the LUNA collapse.
- The token’s death spiral in May has triggered serious financial problems for hedge funds and lenders alike including Three Arrows Capital and Celsius.
- The firm raised about $18.3 million in a Series C funding round.
