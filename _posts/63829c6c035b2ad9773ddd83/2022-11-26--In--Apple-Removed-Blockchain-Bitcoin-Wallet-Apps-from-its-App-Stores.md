Apple has removed the only remaining bitcoin wallet app from its App Stores, leaving users with plenty of questions.

## Highlights

- Apple has removed the only remaining bitcoin wallet app from its App Stores, leaving users with plenty of questions.
- The app was launched in April 2012, its initial submission was rejected by Apple but the app was allowed into the store after some UI/UX tweaks.
- Its interface was more limited compared to its Android counterpart, but it was stable and had not been updated for iOS7 possibly due to fears that updates would need to be scrutinized again by Apple's approval team and risk a ban.
- Apple decided not to wait, and the app has been removed from its iOS App Store for the first time since it launched in 2012.
- The move follows the closure of its own app, which is similar to that of Coinbase, which has also been pulled from the store.
