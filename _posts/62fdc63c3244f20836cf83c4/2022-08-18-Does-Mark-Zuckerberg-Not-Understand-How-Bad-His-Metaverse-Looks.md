Mark Zuckerberg posted a screenshot from Horizon Worlds on Facebook celebrating the game’s release in France and Spain. The image made “Second Life” trend on Twitter for a while yesterday. The problem here is pretty obvious, says

## Highlights

- Mark Zuckerberg posted a screenshot from Horizon Worlds on Facebook celebrating the game’s release in France and Spain.
- The image made “Second Life” trend on Twitter for a while yesterday, with people saying it somehow looked worse than the decades-old life sim.
- Horizon Worlds has looked terrible since its inception and has barely gotten any better over the years, where its avatars still look like Miis from 2012 and they still don’t have legs.
- The concept of the “metaverse” as a whole has become entirely twisted by both Zuckerberg and a literal army of web3 grifters trying to sell real estate and NFTs in empty worlds.
