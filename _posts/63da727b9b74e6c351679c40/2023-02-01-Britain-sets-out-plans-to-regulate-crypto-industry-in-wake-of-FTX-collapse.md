In December, a U.K. minister suggested FTX's failure had reinforced the need for urgent crypto regulation. Now, the government has unveiled its plans.

## Highlights

- The U.K.
- government has proposed a number of measures aimed at bringing regulation of crypto asset businesses in line with that of traditional financial firms.
- The European Union and the U.S.
- have already made proposals of their own to improve consumer protections in crypto.
- A big theme that emerged in 2022 was the rise of risky loans made between multiple crypto firms and a lack of due diligence done on the counterparties involved in those transactions.
- Companies are seeing their valuations slashed by investors after the blowup of FTX and a slump in crypto prices, while the industry has also been plagued by numerous rounds of layoffs.
