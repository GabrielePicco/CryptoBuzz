Vitalik Buterin has stated the opinion that the network will never be significantly quicker than it is presently. He said that decreasing block time was limited by the need for a “safety and decentralization” balance. Buter

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin has outlined why the network is unlikely to get any quicker.
- He said decreasing block time was limited by the need for a “safety and decentralization” balance.
- The “fundamental problem” with Proof-of-Work is the built-in randomization of block time.
- The tradeoff between speed (block time) and security persists for different reasons, as is the case with most blockchain-related challenges (e.g.
- network security) Optimizing for one variable, speed, will almost certainly come at the price of another, he said.
- Emin Gün Sirer, the creator of Ava Labs, tweeted @
