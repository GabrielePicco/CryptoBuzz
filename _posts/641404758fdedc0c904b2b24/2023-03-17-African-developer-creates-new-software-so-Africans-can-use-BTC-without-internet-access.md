Thanks to South African software developer Kgothatso Ngako, the people of Africa can make bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions with Machankura.

## Highlights

- Machankura is being used by approximately 3,000 users in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and Namibia.
- It provides access to the Lightning Network through an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data interface, utilizing mobile phones’ Subscriber Identity Module telecommunication network.
- It’s a great start but there is more work to be done in this space but it offers a business advantage for researchers looking to reach the 2.9 billion people that lack reliable internet access.
- It also helps reduce the cost of international money transfers, which makes it easier for Africans living abroad to send money home to their families and vice versa, according to Pulse Ghana.
