Crypto payments on e-commerce platforms are booming despite market conditions, with Cardano (ADA) entering the top 10 most spend crypto.

## Highlights

- In 2022, the number of crypto transactions increased by 63%, 2.7 times the yearly average in a macroeconomic environment unfavorable for these assets.
- Online merchants saw 927,294 payments with Bitcoin, ETH, Tether, Cardano (ADA), and Binance Coin (BNB) during this period.
- Bitcoin remains king, accounting for around 48% of all processed transactions.
- The Bitcoin Lightning Network represents 6.2% of transactions paid in Bitcoin.
- This number grew from 4.53% in 2021, and it is likely to trend to the upside on the back of further innovation and payment capacity, Coingate said in a report.
