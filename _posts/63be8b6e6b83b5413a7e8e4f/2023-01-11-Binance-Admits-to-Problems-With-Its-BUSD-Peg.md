Analysts reveal the crypto exchange undercollateralized its holdings by at least $1 billion, and not just once.

## Highlights

- Binance Smart Chain BUSD was undercollateralized by at least $1 billion at least three times, say analysts.
- Stablecoins are designed to bring trust and stability into the volatile crypto market.
- Binance claims it keeps BUSD fully collateralized with Paxos-regulated BUSD on its own blockchain.
- Analysts say the issue caused BUSD to slip its peg by that massive margin at least 3 times.
- A Binance spokesperson said the pegging process has since been corrected, but the process has been "much improved with enhanced discrepancy checks to ensure itâ€™s always 1-1 pegged," they said.
- The exchange did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
