The President of El Salvador has said 44 central bank representatives are in the country to discuss Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- 44 countries are meeting in El Salvador to discuss Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
- Most of the attendees are from developing economies, mainly from Africa, including Uganda, Guinea, Nigeria, and Kenya, South America, the Middle East, and Pakistan.
- In 2021, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Panama have since followed El Salvadorâ€™s cue, allowing its citizens to pay using Bitcoin.
- The deflationary nature of Bitcoin, especially, is a huge benefit in shielding wealth against inflation.
- In October, the first Bitcoin Futures Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) was approved by the U.S.
- and subsequently took BTC mainstream.
