Reddit has been aggressive in its push to combine blockchain technology with their widely used social media platform. Recently, Reddit issued free NFTs that

## Highlights

- Reddit has been aggressive in its push to combine blockchain technology with its widely used social media platform.
- Recently, Reddit issued free NFTs that are minted on the Polygon blockchain to itâ€™s top contributors.
- The popularity of the new launched NFT has overshadowed what I believe to be a much bigger milestone in the fight to bring crypto to the masses, the monetization of upvotes/karma.
- The first ERC20 token natively linked to a Reddit subreddit was born called DONUT.
- Then came the beta: r/cryptocurrency Moons and r/FortniteBR Bricks.
- The ratio currently is around 0.44 moons per karma.
