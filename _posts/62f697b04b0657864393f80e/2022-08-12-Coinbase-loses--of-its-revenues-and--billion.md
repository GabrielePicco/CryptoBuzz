Coinbase has unveiled its Q2 2022 revenue and it's not a happy one... A small loss of 60%, not bad but they can do better!

## Highlights

- The company announced a loss of 1.04 billion dollars for the 2nd quarter of 2022.
- Revenues for the same period in 2021 dropped from $2,033 million to just $802 million.
- The company laid off 1,100 employees, or nearly 18% of its workforce in June.
- Since its IPO, the company has lost nearly 72.47% of the value of its stock.
- The investment fund has $10 trillion in assets under management and the company is set to open its Aladdin trading platform to clients via its Prime service.
- With BlackRockâ€™s Aladdin platform opening the door to cryptos for its clients, will the stock fare better?
