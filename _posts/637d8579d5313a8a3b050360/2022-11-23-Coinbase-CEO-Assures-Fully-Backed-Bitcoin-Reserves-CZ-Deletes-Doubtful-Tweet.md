Binance’s CEO released a tweet suggesting Coinbase may be under some financial trouble, but quickly retracted it.

## Highlights

- Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) called attention to two separate claims about the exact number of Bitcoin held by rival exchange.
- The first was a statement from CEO Aaron Schnarch that the company held 635,000 BTC on behalf of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) The second, by contrast, was a 4-months old headline about the exchange holding less than 600,000 Bitcoin.
- Binance's CEO has since deleted his tweet, promising to “work together to improve transparency in the industry” Brian Armstrong quelled concerns about the state of his company's Bitcoin holdings on Tuesday, following doubtful suggestions from CZ.
