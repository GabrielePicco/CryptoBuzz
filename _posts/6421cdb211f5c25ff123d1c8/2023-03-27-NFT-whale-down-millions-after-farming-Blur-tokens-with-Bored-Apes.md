Traders have been buying and selling large numbers of NFTs on the Blur exchange simply to collect the tokens awarded against their activity.

## Highlights

- Jeffrey Huang, better known in the crypto world as Machi Big Brother, has suffered realized losses of up to $4.2 million thanks to his attempts to farm tokens from the Blur NFT exchange.
- Huang is purported to have made the biggest NFT dump in history, selling more than 1,000 NFTs for 11,680 ETH ($20.6 million) Huang is expected to receive more Blur tokens in the incoming airdrop in the next month.
- Itâ€™s unclear why Huang is taking such a huge risk by farming tokens in this manner because they can be bought and sold in the open market.
- However, his crypto history is a little murky and he alleged to have embezzled 22,000 ETH ($38.8 million) from investors in 2018.
