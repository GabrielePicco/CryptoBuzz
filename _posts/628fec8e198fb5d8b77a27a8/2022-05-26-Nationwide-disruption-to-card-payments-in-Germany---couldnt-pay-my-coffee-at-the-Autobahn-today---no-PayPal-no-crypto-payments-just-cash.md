Card payments in Germany are not working well because of a nationwide disruption to card payments. Find out more on what is happening HERE

## Highlights

- Customers and retailers in Germany have been reporting problems paying with EC cards since the 24th of May.
- A bug in a popular reader is to blame, for now, and the only remedy is bills and coins.
- The problem is not with the cards themselves, but with the readers, which can no longer forward the data.
- Customers should pay attention to the relevant signs or announcements in supermarkets when shopping or speak to the staff directly about a possible disruption if they do not have enough cash with them.
- Make sure you have cash when filling up or shopping, especially if you don't have any cash, you should probably ask the sales staff for a moment or lookout for signs at the checkout.
