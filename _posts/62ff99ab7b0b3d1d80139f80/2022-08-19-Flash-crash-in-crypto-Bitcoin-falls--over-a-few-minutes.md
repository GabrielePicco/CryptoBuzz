Cryptocurrencies fell sharply on Friday, with sudden selling dragging bitcoin to a three-week low.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin fell as much as 7.7% to $21,404 over a few minutes during the European morning, at around 0640 GMT.
- It recovered slightly then continued its downward trajectory to trade around $21.400 at 1138 GMT, down 8.2% on the day.
- The reason for the drop was not clear, but experts say it's not showing the pattern of a flash crash.
- On June 15, bitcoin plunged more than 15% as investors were spooked by the collapse of a so-called stablecoin, TerraUSD, and a major crypto lender freezing customer withdrawals.
- The move put bitcoin on track for its worst day since the June meltdown.
