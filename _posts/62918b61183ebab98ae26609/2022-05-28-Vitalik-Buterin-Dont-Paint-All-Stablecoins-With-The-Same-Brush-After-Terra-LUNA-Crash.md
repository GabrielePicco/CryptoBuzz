Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin doesn’t believe the entire category of pure-crypto stablecoins should be dismissed after the collapse of Terra’s (CRYPTO: LUNA) stablecoin Ter

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin doesn’t believe the entire category of pure-crypto stablecoins should be dismissed after the collapse of Terra’s (CRYPTO: LUNA) stablecoin TerraUSD.
- The recent LUNA crash led to a storm of criticism of “algorithmic stablecoins as a category, with many considering them to be a “fundamentally flawed product” The Ethereum creator concluded that the crypto industry should move away from the attitude that it's okay to achieve safety by relying on endless growth.
- “We should evaluate how safe systems are by looking at their steady state, and even the pessimistic state of how they would fare under extreme conditions," he said.
