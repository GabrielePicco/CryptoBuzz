Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the US, might get sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its crypto offerings.

## Highlights

- The SEC told the crypto exchange it had identified potential violations of securities law.
- The notice touched on unspecified portions of its listed digital assets, its staking service, its self-custody crypto wallet and an aspect of its exchange called Coinbase Prime.
- Shares of Coinbase plunged nearly 11% in pre-market trading on Thursday.
- The SEC declined to respond to Insider's request for comment.
- The regulator's crypto crackdown escalated in the aftermath of FX's collapse last November, hasting the urgency to rein in potentially risky offerings, which have been under fire in the wake of the collapse of the Wall Street bull bull bullpies in the U.S.
