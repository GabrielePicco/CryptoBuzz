The country's largest provider of 401(k) retirement plans had previously announced cryptocurrency investments as an option.

## Highlights

- Fidelity Investments is one of the world's largest 401(k) providers.
- Three Democratic senators have asked Fidelity to reverse its decision to expose 401(K) participants to bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments.
- The value of bitcoin, meanwhile, has fallen to a two-year low of $16,209.
- The US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is planning to hold a hearing about FTX in December.
- Fidelity didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, citing "growing interest" from employers and their employees, the senators wrote in a letter.
- The letter marks another cloud over the crypto world, which was already struggling amid rapidly deflating market values.
