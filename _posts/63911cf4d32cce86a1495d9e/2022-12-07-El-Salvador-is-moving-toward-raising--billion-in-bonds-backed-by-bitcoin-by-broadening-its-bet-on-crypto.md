El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele had previously outlined plans to use funds raised from Volcano Bonds to attract investment and buy more bitcoin.

## Highlights

- El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele submitted a bill that seeks to broaden the legal framework to lead to the adoption of all cryptocurrencies in the Central American country.
- In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin as a legal currency.
- The International Monetary Fund has objected to the country's commitment to bitcoin as legal tender and has indicated it wouldn't aid the country with looming debt payments as there are "large risks" associated with the cryptocurrency's volatility.
- The bill may advance to a Congressional vote at a time the cryptocurrency market is mired in a so-called crypto winter, with prices for bitcoin sharply lower than they were last year.
