Sam Bankman-Fried had exuded confidence about FTX future prospects and his legacy before the trading platform's collapse.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was once touted as the cryptocurrency king, a reputation that has eroded with the exchange's collapse resulting in his arrest over fraud charges.
- Before the collapse, he had exuded confidence about the trading platform’s future, sharing the plans to expand FTX and his legacy.
- According to SBF, the long-term plan was to establish FTX as a global platform that allows people to access liquidity in what he termed as ‘a sophisticated powerful way’ At the moment, SBF remains behind bars after being charged with committing fraud against customers by misappropriating their funds to pay for expenses and debts.
