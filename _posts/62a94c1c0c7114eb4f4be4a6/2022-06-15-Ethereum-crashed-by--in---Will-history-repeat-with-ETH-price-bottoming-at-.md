Ether's latest bear market could bring more pains despite anticipations that it would exhaust near $1,200.

## Highlights

- ETH price is now holding above the key support level of the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) near $1,196.
- ETH/USD is almost 75% below its record high, seven months after hitting around $4,950.
- The last time Ether turned oversold was in November 2018, which preceded the end of a 12-month long bear cycle that saw ETH lose 94% of its value.
- ETH's attempt to find a concrete bottom appears against the backdrop of a selling frenzy happening across the crypto and traditional financial markets.
- At the core of its 75% price correction is a hawkish Federal Reserve with its possibility of raising interest rates by 175 basis points by September's end.
