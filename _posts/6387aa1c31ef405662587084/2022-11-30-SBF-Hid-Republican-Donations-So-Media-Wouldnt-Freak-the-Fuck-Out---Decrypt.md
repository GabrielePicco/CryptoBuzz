Bankman-Fried became the poster boy for \"effective altruism\" but only donated publicly to Democratic candidates.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried says he donated "dark money" to avoid public scrutiny.
- FTX US founder and former CEO was one of the largest donors to Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.
- The U.S.
- House Financial Services Committee has called for him to testify in Washington on December 13, 2022.
- He also addressed rumors that he helped Ukraine launder funds for the Democratic Party, which FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan nonprofit for voters, calls the allegations false and says there is no evidence that Ukraine invested in FTX or gave money to FTX.
- He says he gave in the primaries because there are good candidates versus bad candidates rather than bad candidates.
