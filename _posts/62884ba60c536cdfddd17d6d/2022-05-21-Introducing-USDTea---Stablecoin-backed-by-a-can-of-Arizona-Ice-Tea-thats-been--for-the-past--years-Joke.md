AriZona Iced Tea is a stablecoin backed by a hard asset that has maintained the same price for over 30 years. Each USDTea token is equivalent to and redeemable for one 23 ounce can of tea.

## Highlights

- AriZona Iced Tea is a stablecoin backed by a hard asset that has maintained the same price for over 30 years.
- Each token is equivalent to and redeemable for one 23 ounce can of Arizona.
- We are starting small with an initial supply of 1000 tokens, then slowly issuing more as we build up our tea reserves.
- USDTea is implemented with the ERC20 standard to make it convenient for use on the Ethereum blockchain.
- We look forward to USDTeaâ€™s adoption by all major exchanges soon.
- Currently we can only redeem USDTea within the continental United States.
