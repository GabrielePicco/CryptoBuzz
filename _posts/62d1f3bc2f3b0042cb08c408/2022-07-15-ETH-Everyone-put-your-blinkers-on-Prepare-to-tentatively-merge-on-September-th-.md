The PoS vs PoW debate has been a long-running one, where PoS proponents claim it's more environment friendly and equally secure while PoW proponents, including the likes of Jack Dorsey have called PoS centralized and less secure.

## Highlights

- Core developers propose September 19 as the tentative target date for the merger phase of the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) on Thursday.
- The proposed target date didnâ€™t face any objection from the core developers.
- The transition journey to PoS-based ETH 2.0 began on December 1, 2020, with the launch of Beacon Chain.
- The final trial of the merge is set to occur on the Goerli network, which is scheduled for the second week of August.
- Vitalik Buterin has been aggressively defending PoS, arguing that PoS does not include voting on protocol parameters, just like PoW does.
