The cryptocurrency gift can be withdrawn immediately — and is designed to help those who may have been displaced following Russia's invasion.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin gift to Ukrainian users who opened an account on the crypto exchange before March 9.
- The cryptocurrency gift can be withdrawn immediately — and is designed to help those displaced following Russia's invasion.
- A further $1,000 worth of Kraken Fee Credits are being offered to ensure recipients can make currency conversions at no cost.
- The exchange will be hoping to view this as a reasonable compromise, as the trading platform has rejected calls to block its users in Russia.
- The amount of Bitcoin that will be distributed in Tranche 1 on Thursday roughly equates to the total trading fees that were paid by clients based in Russia over the first half of 2022 — effectively meaning that the company is not profiting from their custom trading.
