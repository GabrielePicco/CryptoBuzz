Investors are rethinking their trust in some crypto firms, including Celsius Network, after the companies took drastic steps in the face of a liquidity crisis.

## Highlights

- Celsius Network offers high-yielding interest accounts, often misconstrued as bank-level savings accounts, to retail investors.
- Since its November peak the figure has lost 70% - over two thirds of its value - according to Coinmarketcap.com.
- The firm has frozen its customer accounts to stabilize its operations, but the move has also made it more difficult for customers to meet margin requirements.
- Celsius has hired restructuring lawyers as well as bankers with Citigroup.
- Meanwhile, some of its customers are rallying around the cause to sue the firm and its founder, Alex Mashinsky, over $2 million of his own money is stuck on the platform.
