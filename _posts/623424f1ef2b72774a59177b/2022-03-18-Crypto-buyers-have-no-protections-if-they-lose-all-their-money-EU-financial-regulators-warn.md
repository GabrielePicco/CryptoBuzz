The unregulated crypto industry is a risky place for investors, three of the European Union's financial regulators warned.

## Highlights

- EU regulators warn investors risk losing all their money invested in speculative, "too good to be true" assets.
- The European Union's securities, banking and insurance watchdogs warn consumers they have no protections or recourse to compensation under existing EU financial services law.
- Regulators are increasingly worried that more consumers are buying 17,000 different crypto-assets without being fully aware of the risks, the regulators say.
- The warning marks a ratcheting up of direct warnings to consumers about the risks by EU authorities.
- Consumers should be particularly wary of promised fast or high returns, especially those that look too good, they say.
- They should also be aware that energy consumption is high and that this can have an environmental impact.
