The Ethereum Merge: How will it happen?Why is the Merge supposed to happen, and how the Ethereum Developers are working to make it happen.

## Highlights

- The Merge, Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol that has been repeatedly postponed, now appears likely to take place in August 2022.
- The “difficulty bomb” is a program embedded in the Ethereum blockchain that deliberately slows the network down.
- It was created to encourage miners to switch to PoS after the Merge by making it harder to stay on the proof of work (PoW) chain.
- The Merge is projected to reduce ETH issuance by 90% because there are fewer ETH in circulation, there is less supply and more demand, pushing the price up.
- According to CoinMarketCap, 1 ETH is currently worth $2,000 USD.
