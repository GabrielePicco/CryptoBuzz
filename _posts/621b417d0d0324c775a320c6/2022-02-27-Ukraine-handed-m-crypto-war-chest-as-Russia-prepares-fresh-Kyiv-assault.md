Ukraine's government has raised a $15 million war chest in cryptocurrency donations as Russia closes in on Kyiv.

## Highlights

- Ukraine handed $15m crypto war chest as Russia prepares fresh Kyiv assault.
- The huge sum includes an anonymous gift of three million US dollars in Bitcoin.
- The average donation throughout the conflict amounting to around $95.
- Non-governmental organisations have been raising crypto funds for years during ongoing border tensions, but nothing on the scale of transactions during the current crisis.
- One such group – Come Back Alive – has received several millions over the last few days, despite being suspended by content creation platform Patreatre for allegedly breaching its terms.
- Researchers say volunteers have played a critical role in the Russo-Ukraine conflict over the past decade, and they are often closely linked to the Ukrainian government.
