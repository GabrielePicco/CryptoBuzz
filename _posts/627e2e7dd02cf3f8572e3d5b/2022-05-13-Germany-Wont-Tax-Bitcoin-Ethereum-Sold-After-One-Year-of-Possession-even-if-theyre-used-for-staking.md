Cryptocurrencies can be sold tax free after one year of possession, according to Germany's finance ministry.

## Highlights

- Germany's finance ministry issues first guidance on tax treatment of cryptocurrencies.
- The 24-page document covers various aspects of crypto-related issues.
- The sale of acquired cryptocurrencies is now tax-free for individuals after one year of owning the assets.
- Previously, cryptocurrencies used for staking or to generate a profit may have had to be held for up to 10 years to receive a tax exemption.
- The publication of the guidance comes six months after the new German government included cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in its coalition agreement, describing them as the key elements that will support the countryâ€™s development over the next four years.
- The document also deals with mining, staking, lending, hard forks, and token airdrops.
