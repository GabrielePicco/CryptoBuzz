Ethereum went live with another shadow fork today to test a specific feature before its transition to proof of stake.

## Highlights

- The blockchain's ninth shadow fork went live 15 hours ahead of schedule this morning.
- The move to proof of stake is one of the last tests required prior to the Merge.
- Today's test focused on testing a feature called MEV Boost, which will allow validators to offer space within blocks they create to other validators.
- The proof-of-stake method of creating new ETH will be 99% more environmentally-friendly than the current, energy-intensive proof of work model, but it will also mean lower profits to the individuals involved.
- The Merge is expected to strand thousands of miners, who will likely be unable to match the profit model of ETH mining post-Merge.
