Aiden Pleterski, 24, is the self-described \"crypto king\" who allegedly collected at least $40/41.5 million from clients that he was supposed to invest into cryptocurrency and the foreign exchange market. Instead

## Highlights

- Aiden Pleterski, 24, was a self-described “crypto king” from Canada who bilked clients out of millions of dollars.
- Instead of investing the money, he spent at least 38 percent — nearly $16 million — on living the high life, as seen below via his Instagram.
- Some of his victims reportedly kidnapped the 24-year-old and tortured him late last year.
- He was eventually released days later by his landlord on the condition that he come up with the ransom money his kidnappers wanted ASAP.
- His parents have agreed to a settlement in bankruptcy proceedings against him and have returned at least $1 million from their fraudulent business.
