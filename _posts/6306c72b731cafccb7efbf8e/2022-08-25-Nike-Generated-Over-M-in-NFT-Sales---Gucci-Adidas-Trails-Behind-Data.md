The NFT hype among some of the most sought-after fashion brands may not fade anytime soon after all.

## Highlights

- Nike's NFT-related projects have generated over $185 million in revenue, placing itself as the biggest earning brand.
- The sports brand raked in $1.3 billion in transaction volume with $93 million from primary sales of NFTs while generating $92 million in the form of royalties.
- The development comes amid a significant decline in NFT sales over the past several months as a result of the choppy market move.
- D&G leads with more than 9,000 transactions, closely followed by Gucci with nearly 4,000.
- Even though Adidas was placed fifth in terms of total revenue, it boasted the second most amount of transactions at over 51,000
