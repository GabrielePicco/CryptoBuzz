Decentralized exchange Uniswap provided data breaking down which addresses it has blocked so far and why. The data was later removed.

## Highlights

- Decentralized exchange Uniswap has blocked 253 addresses in four months of working with analytics firm TRM Labs.
- The addresses were mostly blocked because of connections with stolen funds or transaction mixing services like Tornado Cash, recently sanctioned by the US Treasury.
- 30 of the addresses were associated with ENS names, which are human readable names used to make it easier to send crypto payments to those wallets.
- The data was published on GitHub by software engineer Jordan Frankfurt, according to Yearn Finance core developer Banteg, who saved the data in a tweet thread and on GitHub.
- We reached out to Frankfurt for comment and will update this article should we hear back.
