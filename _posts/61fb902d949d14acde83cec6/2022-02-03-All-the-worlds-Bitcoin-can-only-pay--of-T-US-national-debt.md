Bitcoin pales in comparison to U.S. national debt this year, with all available BTC worth less than 3% of the debt total.

## Highlights

- The United States' national debt has passed $30 trillion — and even all the Bitcoin in the world would hardly touch it.
- The U.S.
- national debt is at levels never seen before, passing the psychological $30-trillion barrier for the first time this week.
- Bitcoin, with a market capitalization of $731 billion, it is 2.43% of the national debt tally.
- The sheer size of the total did not go unnoticed by Bitcoin proponents, who discussed the topic in earnest on social media.
- Gold bug Peter Schiff, meanwhile, delivered a grim forecast for the overall debt trend.
