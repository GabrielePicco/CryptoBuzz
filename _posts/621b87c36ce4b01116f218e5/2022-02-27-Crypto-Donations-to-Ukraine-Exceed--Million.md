Crypto donations to Ukraine continue, with the total count exceeding $13 million already. Justin Sun made a $200,000 transaction worth of Tether (USDT).

## Highlights

- Reports indicate that more than $13 million worth of digital assets have been sent to the provided addresses.
- The country’s authorities, through its official Twitter account, asked for more help in the form of bitcoin, ether, and USDT.
- Many questioned the validity of these wallets, including Vitalik Buterin, who stood openly against the war, despite being born in Russia.
