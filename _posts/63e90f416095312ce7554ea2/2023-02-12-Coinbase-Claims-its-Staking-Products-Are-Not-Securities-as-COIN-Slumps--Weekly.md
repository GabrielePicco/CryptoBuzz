There is no imbalance of information in staking, the company said in its blog post.

## Highlights

- The largest US-based bitcoin exchange has responded to the SEC's decision to pursue certain crypto staking offerings in the States.
- The exchange’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, asserted in the blog post that the company's staking services do not meet the Howey test criteria.
- The SEC uses four characteristics to determine whether an investment asset falls under Howey's securities category – efforts of other parties, investment of money, expectations of profit, and common enterprise.
- The exec highlighted the need for appropriate regulations that will not halt the sector's development.
- If the US fails to do so, the country risks losing users to offshore jurisdictions.
