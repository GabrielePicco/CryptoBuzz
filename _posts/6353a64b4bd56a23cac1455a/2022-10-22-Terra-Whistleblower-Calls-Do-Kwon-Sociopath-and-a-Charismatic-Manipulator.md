FatMan said it all boils down to \"manipulation, lying to the public, and unfairly enriching themselves through mechanisms that were not made public.\"

## Highlights

- Terra creator Do Kwon slammed “misinformation” floating in the media and downplayed serious charges by South Korean authorities as well as Interpol.
- The famed Terra whistleblower, FatMan, has now weighed in on the controversial figure’s statements made a few days prior.
- FatMan argued that Kwon did not pledge a single dollar of his money to compensate for the losses that hit investors.
- Kwon said to all investors that lost funds that he was sorry, but the anonymous sleuth believes a verbal apology doesn’t do anything.
- The only fair remedy to that is to return a portion of his “ill-gotten” gains.
