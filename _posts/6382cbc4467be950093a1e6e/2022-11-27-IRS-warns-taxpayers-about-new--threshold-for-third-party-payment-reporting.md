The IRS on Tuesday warned taxpayers about the new $600 threshold for receiving Form 1099-K for third-party payments. Here's why you may receive one.

## Highlights

- The IRS on Tuesday shared tips for the upcoming tax season, including a reminder about the new $600 threshold for receiving Form 1099-K for third-party payments.
- The change applies to payments from third party networks, such as Venmo or PayPal, for transactions such as part-time work, side jobs or selling goods.
- Aimed at closing the tax gap — a top priority of the Biden administration — the provision is estimated to bring in $8.4 billion from fiscal year 2021 to 2031, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
- "It's going to be a new form for a lot of people," said Adam Markowitz, an enrolled agent.
