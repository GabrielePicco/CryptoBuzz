NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge showed growing impatience Thursday with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s use of the internet while on bail, suggesting that incarceration might eventually be the most effective way to prevent him from communicating on electronic devices in ways that can't be traced.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried returned to a New York courtroom for the second time in two weeks to explain why he keeps accessing parts of the internet that the government can't monitor and how it might affect his bail.
- Judge Lewis A. Kaplan did not immediately change a $250 million bail package that lets him live with his parents in Palo Alto, California, while preparing for trial on charges that he cheated investors and looted customer deposits at FTX, his cryptocurrency trading platform.
- Prosecutors asked the judge to more severely limit his use of electronic devices and the internet, including banning him from messaging applications and requiring the installation of a monitoring program on his cellphone and computer.
