Nearly half of all 'Cryptok' creators were trying to promote their own products and trading groups alongside misleading crypto content.

## Highlights

- A new study found that more than one-third of videos on TikTok contain misleading information.
- TikTok's CEO Shou Chew testified before the United States Congress last month in a five-hour hearing that put legislators’ skepticism of the social media site on full display.
- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordered TikTok and seven other social media sites to report their anti-fraud advertising practices in March.
- In December, Bloomberg indicated that the FTC was probing “several” companies for their crypto advertising practices.
- Only 10% of accounts included in the dappGambl study included included a disclaimer or warning about the risks of investing money in crypto.
