A new South Park episode takes aim at crypto endorsements by Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Reese Witherspoon, Larry David and Naomi Osaka.

## Highlights

- South Park's new episode takes aim at celebrities who have recently endorsed crypto, including Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon.
- The episode spends the most time on Damon, alluding to his widely-panned advert for Crypto.com.
- Celebrities like Naomi Osaka, Naomi Osaka and Larry David are also mocked in the episode.
- South Park has been slow on the uptake with crypto, with the first official reference came at the end of last year, just as Bitcoin was cooling down from its 2021 bull run.
- With prices where they're at now, it's unlikely crypto enthusiasts are in on the joke.
