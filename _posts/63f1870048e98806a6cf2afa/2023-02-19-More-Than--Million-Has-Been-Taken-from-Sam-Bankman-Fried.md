Sam Bankman-Fried, the former executive of FTX, says he only had $100K to his name, but the government has uncovered $700 million.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced head executive of the now defunct FTX, says he only had about $100,000 to his name after his business fell into bankruptcy and he was arrested on alleged fraud charges.
- But it appears federal prosecutors have seized as much as $700 million, all of which is believed to have been in accounts owned by SBF himself or by the exchange.
- This is all occurring under the new CEO of the company John Ray III, who also took over for the disaster known as Enron when it fell to the ground nearly 20 years ago.
- The SEC recently filed a civil suit against the former crypto head.
