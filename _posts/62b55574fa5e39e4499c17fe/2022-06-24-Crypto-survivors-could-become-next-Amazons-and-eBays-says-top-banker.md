Not everyone think's Bitcoin is dead… the Bank of England's deputy said some pretty positive things about the crypto industry this week.

## Highlights

- Bank of England's deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said some pretty positive things about the crypto industry this week.
- He compared the current crypto market crash to the early days of the internet – an oft-referenced tale of boom, bust and phoenixes rising from ashes.
- The BoE is now considering whether to create an independent CBDC with an “on or off ramp to fiat” or “something that is flexible enough” to be used in private stablecoins.
- The British government has outlined a detailed plan to make the nation “a hospitable place” for the digital-asset class and turn the UK into a global cryptoasset technology hub.
