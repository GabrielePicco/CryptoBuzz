It turns out that the Japanese simply don’t need a digital version of their national currency. The island’s financial cyberspace is already teeming with a plethora of optimized, cheap banking…

## Highlights

- Bank of Japan has realized that a so-called CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) is probably not the right way to proceed.
- Cash is still popular in Japan, with 80% of all purchases made in cash last year.
- Cash will always be more trusted because it has no digital ledger.
- CBDCs also seem to have a bad reputation that they will have a hard time getting rid of.
- Bitcoin will always gain more trust in the long run than a CBDC because of this awkward setup.
- Japan’s population is shrinking by 500,000 people each year, which encourages continued use of cash.
