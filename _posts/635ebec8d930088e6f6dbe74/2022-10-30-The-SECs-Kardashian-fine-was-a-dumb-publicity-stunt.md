L’affaire Kardashian is yet another instance of Gary Gensler prioritizing his ambitions over sound crypto regulation.

## Highlights

- Kim Kardashian was slapped with a $1.26 million fine for promoting a cryptocurrency on Instagram.
- The fine was the top story of the day in the business and tech press.
- Gensler's agency failed to spot the massive fraud underlying Terra and Celsius earlier this year that helped wipe out more than $1 trillion, much of it from small investors.
- The SEC has refused to provide clarity on what constitutes a security in crypto markets, leaving companies to guess the SEC’s rules instead of crafting a legal process to define them.
- The decision to prioritize media antics and his own ego is actively hurting investors and the country.
- We deserve better.
