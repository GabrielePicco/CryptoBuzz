Moons moved a few months ago to the Arbitrum Nova mainnet, and there its crypto community learned to work as a team.

## Highlights

- Reddit’s Moons is an ERC-20 that pays out rewards to its users and investors in moons.
- Moons is distributed using Reddit Karma, a kind of internal regulator that determines the merit of each user.
- One user managed to earn $400 in Moons in a very short time by writing only Moons-related posts on Reddit: “For me, it’�s the stroke of the upvote — the childish part of me that never stopped waiting for the approval of authority figures to tell me I did something right or good or praiseworthy” One user suggested that: "Cryptocurrency can make you really rich or broke overnight.
- Invest/play within your means"
