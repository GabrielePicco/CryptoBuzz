Ether continues to slide as investors shift to a wait-and-see approach regarding future upgrades, the bank said in a research report.

## Highlights

- The four largest stablecoins had exchange net inflows for the third week in a row.
- Large Binance USD (BUSD) inflows/USD coin (USDC) outflows could be the result of investors “preemptively rotating” into BUSD from USDC.
- Ether continues to slide as investors shift to a wait-and-see approach regarding future upgrades, the bank said in a report.
- Binance’s decision to auto convert some stablecoins into its own stablecoin may have led to outflow of BUSD, the report said.
