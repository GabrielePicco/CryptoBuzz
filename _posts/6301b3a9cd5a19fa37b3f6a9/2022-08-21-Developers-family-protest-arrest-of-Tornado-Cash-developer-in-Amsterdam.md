A group of crypto and privacy advocates are protesting the arrest of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev.

## Highlights

- A group of about 50 crypto and privacy advocates are protesting the arrest of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in Amsterdam.
- Pertssev was arrested by Dutch authorities in the Netherlands on August 12, two days after the US government sanctioned Tornado Cash, claiming it was used to launder stolen funds for North Korean actors.
- Those protesting argue that Pertsav should not be held responsible for writing open-source code, regardless of how itâ€™s used by bad actors.
- A Telegram group set up to coordinate the protest includes Yearn Finance core developer Banteg and Aave founder Stani Kulechov.
- There might be a second protest in London in the next few weeks.
