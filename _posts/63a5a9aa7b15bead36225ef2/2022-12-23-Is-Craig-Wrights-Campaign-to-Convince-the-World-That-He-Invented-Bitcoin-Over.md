I no longer care what you think,” he says. “I seek to see my creation used.”

## Highlights

- Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist, has claimed for years to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.
- Wright says he is no longer seeking external validation, but wants to see his ideas come to fruition.
- Wright has never been able to produce the private keys to Satoshi's Bitcoin address, the only way to prove his claim.
- A British court ruled in August that Wright submitted “deliberately false” evidence in a defamation case he filed against a podcaster who repeatedly called him a “fraud’s” The judge ultimately awarded Wright damages of £1, stating it would be “unconscionable” for Wright to receive anything more after submitting false evidence.
