Analysts say an increasing number of loans are underwater, as many of the mining rigs that lenders accepted as collateral have halved in value, along with the price of Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- Bitcoinâ€™s decline is making it more difficult for some miners to repay as much as $4 billion in loans backed by their equipment.
- Analysts say an increasing number of loans are underwater, as many of the mining rigs that lenders accepted as collateral have halved in value, along with the price of Bitcoin.
- Few miners have defaulted so far, but some have sold Bitcoin reserves, which puts further pressure on prices.
- The cost of equipment may fall even lower if lenders begin to liquidate mining equipment that they repossess, analysts say.
- Total costs for some mining companies may already be above $20,000, which is about Bitcoin's current price.
