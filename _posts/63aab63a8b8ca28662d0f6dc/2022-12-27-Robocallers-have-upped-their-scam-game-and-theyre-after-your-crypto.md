Fraudsters are using the turmoil caused by recent crypto bankruptcies to power their scam calling and texting campaigns, according to Truecaller senior executive advisor, Clayton LiaBraaten.

## Highlights

- Scammers are targeting cryptocurrency users following the collapse of FTX.
- Scammers use the turmoil caused by recent bankruptcies to power their scam calling and texting campaigns.
- Younger people are more often targeted by fraudsters as “there’s so much information available about them because they put so much out there on social media,” according to Truecaller senior executive advisor, Clayton LiaBraaten.
- He said anyone who calls or messages asking for personal information or passwords should not be engaged with and only official channels should be used to get in contact with scammers.
- The scam involved sending users a text message with a link to cancel withdrawals, leading users to a fake website designed to harvest their login credentials.
