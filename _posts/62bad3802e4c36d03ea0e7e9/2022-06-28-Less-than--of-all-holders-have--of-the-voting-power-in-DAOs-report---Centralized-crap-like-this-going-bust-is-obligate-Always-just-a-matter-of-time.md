The Chainalysis report highlighted that although all governance token holders have voting rights, the right to make a new proposal for the community and to pass it is not very easy for everyone, given the number of tokens required to do so.

## Highlights

- Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are organizations without a centralized hierarchy.
- DAOs were intended to work in a bottom-up manner so that the community collectively owns and contributes to the decision-making process.
- A recent report from Chainalysis analyzed the workings of ten major DAO projects and found that on average, less than 1% of all holders have 90% of the voting power.
- The report highlighted that although all governance token holders have voting rights, the right to make a proposal for the community and to pass it is not very easy for everyone, given the number of tokens required to do so.
- The Solana-based lending DAO Solend tried to take over a whale's account and execute the liquidation themselves.
