Samsung Foundry revealed that the new Bitcoin miner chips it manufactures on 3nm GAA technology gain up to 45% energy efficiency. 2nm chips are coming 2025. - SamMobile

## Highlights

- Samsung Foundry began manufacturing chipsets for Bitcoin miners on the new 3nm GAA manufacturing process in late June.
- The 3nm-based mining chipsets are roughly 23-to-45% more energy-efficient than chipsets manufactured on previous nodes.
- The new chipsets gain up to 45% energy efficiency.
- The company should also use the 3nm technology to manufacture smartphone chipsets — eventually — but the initial trial run consisted of chips for Bitcoin mining.
- The President Dr.
- Siyoung Choi also confirmed that 3nm manufacturing will remain at the forefront for the next few years.
