The IOG team said that by delaying the fork it was \"taking an abundance of caution to ensure that we do this deployment correctly.\"

## Highlights

- Cardano Vasil hard fork update proposal delayed to allow for more testing.
- The Input-Output Global (IOG) team said it still needs to solve seven outstanding bugs that are currently ranked as non-severe.
- The decision to postpone the hard fork followed the core team’s end-of-the-week evaluation call.
- The IOG team said that by delaying the fork it was “taking an abundance of caution to ensure that we do this deployment correctly” The final decision to hard fork the Cardano Testnet will be made in consultation with “members of the SPO and DApp development community” If more time is still needed the developers will be fully comfortable with this, the team explained.
