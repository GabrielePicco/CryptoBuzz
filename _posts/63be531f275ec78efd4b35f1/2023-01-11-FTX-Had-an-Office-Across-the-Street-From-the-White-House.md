FTX is currently trying to get out of a six-year lease it signed for WeWork office space across the street from the White House.

## Highlights

- FTX used to have a D.C.
- office across the street from the White House and Treasury Department.
- The location appears to be a WeWork co-working location, where companies can sign leases for permanent, private work spaces.
- FTX, once the second-largest centralized crypto exchange by volume behind Binance, took a big hit when a report revealed that Alameda Research, its trading desk, held billions worth of illiquid FTX Token (FTT) on its balance sheet against billions in liabilities.
- The White House has been reluctant to answer questions about donations made by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to President Joe Biden's campaign.
