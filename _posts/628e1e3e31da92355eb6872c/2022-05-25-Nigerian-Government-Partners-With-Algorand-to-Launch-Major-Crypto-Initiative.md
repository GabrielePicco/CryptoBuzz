The Developing Africa Group picked Koibanx as their tokenization and payment engine. The wallet will be constructed on top of the Algorand blockchain system.

## Highlights

- The Developing Africa Group has agreed to help build a nationwide wallet for the next three years.
- Commercialization of IP forms registered and generated in the nation would be allowed.
- Patents trademarks, and all copyrights, including videos, shows, lectures, podcasts, and any streamable material, are among the IP forms described above.
- The wallet will be constructed on top of the Algorand blockchain system.
- With Koibanx, a leading Latin American asset tokenization and blockchain financial infrastructure business in charge of the wallet and token development, the inventor will get a stable token (equivalent to the Naira) that will compensate for their intellectual property.
