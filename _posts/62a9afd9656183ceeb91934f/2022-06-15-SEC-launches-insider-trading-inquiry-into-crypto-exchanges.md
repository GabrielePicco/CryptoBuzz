The SEC is eyeing crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, FTX and Crypto.com FOX Business has learned.

## Highlights

- The SEC has launched an inquiry into whether crypto exchanges have proper safeguards to prevent insider trading on their platforms.
- The move comes amid yet another massive upheaval in crypto and greater scrutiny by regulators over the nascent market.
- The price of Bitcoin — the most popular digital coin — lost nearly a third of its value in the past week and is down 70% from its November all-time high.
- In May, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler took aim at crypto exchanges, accusing them of trading against their clients.
- It could not be determined if the inquiry is being led by the SEC's enforcement division or Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, which often conducts preliminary examinations.
