A former top Blackrock executive and investment advisor believes that despite the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin will become an integral

## Highlights

- Edward Dowd believes bitcoin is capable of surpassing gold due to its unique features: the ability to make digital transactions, transparency and decentralization.
- Dowd compared the cryptocurrency market to the dot-com era, when the vast majority of Internet companies shut down and only stronger competitors managed to survive.
- The mood among traders is now more optimistic, with bitcoin rising to $22,500 and the overall capitalization of the market beginning to recover, returning to the $1 trillion mark.
- As former BitMEX chief Arthur Hayes said recently, bitcoin is expected to grow rapidly as the U.S.
- Federal Reserve may print trillions of dollars again.
