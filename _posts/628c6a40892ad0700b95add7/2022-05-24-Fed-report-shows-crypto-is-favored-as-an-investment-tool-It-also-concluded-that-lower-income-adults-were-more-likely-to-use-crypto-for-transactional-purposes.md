In 2021, 12% of adults held or used cryptocurrency, according to the report, and they were more likely to hold as an investment.

## Highlights

- Federal Reserve issues annual report on financial well-being of US residents.
- 12% of adults surveyed held or used cryptocurrency, according to the report.
- Lower-income adults were more likely to use crypto for transactional purposes than high-income ones.
- Only two percent of adults used it for purchases and one percent to send money to friends or family.
- Nearly all, 99%, had a bank account, the report says, and the report indicated self-reported financial well being was at its highest level since the survey began in 2013.
- The research was conducted prior to the Omicron variant surge in 2021, which could have affected the outcome of the study had the research occurred later.
