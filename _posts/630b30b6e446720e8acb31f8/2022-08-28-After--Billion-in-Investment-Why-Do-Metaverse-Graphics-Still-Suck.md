The metaverse has been touted as the place where we’ll spend our lives in the future—but the visuals still leave a lot to be desired.

## Highlights

- Metaverse platforms have come in for criticism for their graphical stylings.
- Some platforms like Decentraland are rendered in blocky, cartoonish visuals reminiscent of a 2000s-vintage game.
- Graphics cards and broadband connection speeds limit the ability for metaverses to present highly detailed graphics.
- Metaverses often have worse graphics than MMO games because they are, by design, much more open-world.
- The issue is particularly vexed when it comes to legs, which are “super hard and basically not workable just from a physics standpoint with existing headsets”, says Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s then president of Reality Labs.
