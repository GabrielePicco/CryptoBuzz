A diner who had invested in cryptocurrency gave a server at a Pennsylvania restaurant a whopping $3,000 tip on a $13 bill, according to a new report.

## Highlights

- Eric Smith paid for a stromboli at Alfredo’s Cafe in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on June 16.
- The generous customer wrote “Tips for Jesus” on his receipt, in an apparent reference to the anonymous Instagram account “tipsforjesus” A manager at the family-owned restaurant said Smith was a Pennsylvania native “involved in cryptocurrency” who wanted to “give back to the community” The restaurant manager said he was happy to see that people are giving back to a hard industry where it's hard to be involved in, especially during Covidia, a former PayPal executive Jack Selby.
