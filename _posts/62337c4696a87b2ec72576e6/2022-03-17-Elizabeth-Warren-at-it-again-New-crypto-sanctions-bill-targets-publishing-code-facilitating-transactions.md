Bill would place sweeping restrictions on persons who build, operate, and use cryptocurrency networks even if they have no knowledge or intent to help evade…

## Highlights

- Bill would place sweeping restrictions on persons who build, operate, and use cryptocurrency networks even if they have no knowledge or intent to help evade sanctions.
- Bill calls for sanctioning technologists and users merely for the act of publishing open source software or facilitating communication among network participants.
- It calls for sanctions on anyone who “significantly and materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of any [sanctioned] person’s] person.” The bill is unnecessary, overbroad, and unconstitutional.
- It is not unreasonable for Congress to call on the President to sanction every person who performs these activities irrespective of their intent to facilitate illicit activities.
