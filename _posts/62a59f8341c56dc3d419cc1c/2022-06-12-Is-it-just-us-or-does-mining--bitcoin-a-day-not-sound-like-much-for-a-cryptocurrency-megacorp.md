Update: We previously suggested that the company may be experiencing 'theoretical' losses. After which, Hut 8 got in contact with us explaining \"Our financial results demonstr

## Highlights

- Hut 8 Mining Corp says it's not experiencing 'theoretical' losses, as it continues to be profitable.
- Company says it holds 7,078 self-mined bitcoin in reserve, that's around $210 million in today's market.
- Back in January, one bitcoin was worth $47,733, but since then, a single bitcoin has dropped to a worth of just $29,509.
- Despite 1,500 increase in bitcoin held, that actually works out as a comparative loss of around $57 million.
- And yet, the company continues to expand its operations in North Bay, Ontario, and Medicine Hat, Alberta, which run off "an abundance of renewable energy"
