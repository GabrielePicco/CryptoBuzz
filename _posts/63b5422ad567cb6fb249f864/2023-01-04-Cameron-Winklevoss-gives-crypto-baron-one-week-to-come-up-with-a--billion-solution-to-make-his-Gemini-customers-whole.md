Winklevoss and his identical twin brother first rose to prominence through their lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, who they claimed stole their idea for Facebook.

## Highlights

- Cameron Winklevoss, cofounder of digital token exchange Gemini, has issued a one-week ultimatum to cough up nearly $1 billion.
- Barry Silbert, founder of unlisted Digital Currency Group, must find a solution to make Gemini users whole.
- Silbert accused of “unconscionable” behavior by hiding away from his creditors in an “ivory tower” in an open letter.
- The Gemini president said he was acting as a steward for the more than 340,000 Gemini Earn users whose over $900 million in crypto has been trapped at DCG’s Genesis Global Capital since mid-November.
