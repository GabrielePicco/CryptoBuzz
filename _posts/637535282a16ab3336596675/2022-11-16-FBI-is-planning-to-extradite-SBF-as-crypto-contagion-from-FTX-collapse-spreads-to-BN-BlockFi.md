FTX owner Sam Bankman-Fried, 30, may be brought back to the states by authorities. Bankman-Fried was worth an estimate $16 billion before the crisis but his fortune is down 94%.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried may be brought back to the U.S.
- from the Bahamas, where he has listed his five-bedroom Bahamas penthouse on the market for $40 million.
- FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Friday, sending tsunami-like waves through the cryptocurrency industry.
- BlockFi halted withdrawals over the weekend and is now actively considering bankruptcy and plans to lay off its staff.
- The events are reminiscent of the failures of Wall Street firms during the 2008 financial crisis, particularly now that supposedly healthy firms like FTX are failing.
- Bankman Fried, 30, was worth an estimated $16bn before the crisis but his fortune is down 94%
