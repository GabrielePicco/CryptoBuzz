MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has topped his Bitcoin shopping spree by 1,045 BTC, to a total of 140,000 BTC. Saylor’s Bitcoin stake is 0.6% out of Bitcoin’

## Highlights

- Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, continues to pile up more Bitcoin.
- Saylor's business intelligence firm bought an extra 1,045 BTC between March 24 to April 4, according to the latest 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Saylor’s game plan is to ‘corner the market’ early on, says Tim Fries.
- The average Bitcoin price was $28,016, suggesting a bull run narrative on the horizon.
- At 140,000 BTC, Saylor now holds one out of every 150 Bitcoin in existence, or 0.6% out of Bitcoin's 21 million supply.
- At the same time, this leaves 17.3 million BTC in potential circulation.
