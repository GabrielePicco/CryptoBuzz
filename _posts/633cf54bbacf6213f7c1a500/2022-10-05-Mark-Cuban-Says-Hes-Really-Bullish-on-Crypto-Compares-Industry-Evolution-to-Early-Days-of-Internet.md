Billionaire Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban says he's still bullish on crypto despite the ongoing bear market.

## Highlights

- Billionaire Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban says he’s still bullish on crypto despite the ongoing bear market.
- Cuban compares the crypto sector to the early days of streaming in the 1990s, when the now-common technology was hard to use and ignored by mainstream consumers.
- Cuban: "We're in the early ‘hassle’ phases.
- We’re waiting for that next round of applications, and there's a lot of people working on them" Cuban notes the internet also had a lull period from 1995 until 2007 when the first iPhone was released, when mobile applications exploded and the internet expanded to a whole bunch of new functions.
