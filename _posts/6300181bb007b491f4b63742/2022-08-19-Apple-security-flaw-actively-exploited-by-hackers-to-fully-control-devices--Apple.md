Users of iPhone, iPad and Mac advised to update software to secure them against vulnerability

## Highlights

- Apple users advised to update their iPhones, iPads and Macs to protect against a pair of security vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to take complete control of their devices.
- One of the software weaknesses affects the kernel, the deepest layer of the operating system.
- The other affects WebKit, the underlying technology of the Safari web browser.
- There are credible reports that hackers are already abusing the vulnerabilities to attack users.
- Anyone with an iPhone released since 2015, an iPad released since 2014 or a Mac running macOS Monterey can download the update by opening up the settings menu on their mobile device.
- Such weaknesses are hugely valuable on the open market, where cyberweapon brokers will buy them for hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars.
