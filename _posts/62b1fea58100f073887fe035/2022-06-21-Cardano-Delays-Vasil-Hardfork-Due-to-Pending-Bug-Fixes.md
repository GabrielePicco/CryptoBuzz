Input Output Global, the company behind Cardano, has postponed its long-awaited Vasil hardfork upgrade to the last week of July.

## Highlights

- Cardano has postponed its Vasil hardfork upgrade to the last week of July.
- The company behind Cardano cited seven bugs as the reason for the delay.
- The upgrade would take the network to the new “Basho” era.
- The Vasil update is Cardano’s most significant update since the Alonzo hardfork launched last September.
- It's hoped that the hardfork will improve the “concurrency” problem that has severely impaired the scalability of DeFi apps on Cardano.
- The upgrade is part of Cardano's long-planned transition from the so-called Goguen to the Basho era.
