Prosecutors say that Thevamanogari Manivel and Jatinder Singh went on a spending spree after receiving the accidental windfall from the crypto site.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors say Thevamanogari Manivel and Jatinder Singh went on a spending spree with the money sent by Crypto.com.
- The exchange mistakenly transferred $10.5 million, rather than $100, to the couple's account in May 2021 after entering the wrong figure in the payment field.
- It took the company seven months to realize its mistake and try to recover the funds.
- The couple face sentences of up to 20 years each if found guilty of stealing the funds from Commonwealth Bank Australia.
- The pair have pleaded not guilty to theft, and a further hearing is scheduled for late March, court heard that $2 million in cash was still unaccounted for and assets worth a further $1 million.
