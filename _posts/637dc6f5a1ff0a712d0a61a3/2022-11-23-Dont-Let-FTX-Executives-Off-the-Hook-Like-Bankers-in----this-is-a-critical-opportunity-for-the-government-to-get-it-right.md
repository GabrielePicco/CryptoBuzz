More regulation isn't enough to fix the crypto space after the collapse of FTX, prosecutors need to get involved

## Highlights

- The collapse of FTX, the world’s second largest crypto-exchange, raises major questions about the viability of the financial regulatory system.
- FTX is not the last or even the largest player to fail, but it was licensed and registered with the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) Many on the left and right want to keep crypto out of the regulatory system, but the failure to prosecute individuals who broke the law is a key lesson from the last financial crisis that we must not forget as we enter the crypto crisis, says Andrew Hammond.
- Hammond: We must ensure that those who might have broken the law at FTX be aggressively prosecuted.
