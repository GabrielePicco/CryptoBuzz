Investors don't really care if your blockchain burns a lot of electricity. See BlackRock's recent embrace of greenhouse gas burning Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- Polkadot, Tezos and other proof-of-stake blockchains have been crushed over the last 12 months.
- Bitcoin's energy consumption has been an issue for bitcoin for a few years now.
- Some estimates can have as much of a carbon footprint as driving a gas-powered sedan 600 miles.
- Some estimates of Bitcoin's yearly energy consumption place it on par with that of Ecuador’s entire energy use.
- If Bitcoin were a country, its annual energy consumption would equal Ukraine.
- The appetite for initiatives leveraging blockchain technology to solve climate change issues is extremely high, says Jacopo Visetti, Project Lead and Co-founder at EFFORCE.
