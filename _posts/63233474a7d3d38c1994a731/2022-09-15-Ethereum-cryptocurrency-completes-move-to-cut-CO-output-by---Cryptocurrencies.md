Software upgrade, known as ‘the merge’, will change how transactions are managed on its blockchain

## Highlights

- Software upgrade, known as ‘the merge’, will change how transactions are managed on the ethereum blockchain.
- The move will reduce the carbon emissions linked to ethereum by more than 99%.
- It means ethereum will no longer be created by an energy intensive process known as'mining' The process will now move to a “proof of stake” system, where individuals and companies act as validators, pledging or “staking” their own ether as a form of guarantee, to win newly created tokens.
- The move could represent 0.2% of the world’s electricity consumption disappearing overnight.
- Bitcoin is worth $387bn, having fallen sharply from its peak of $1tn last year.
