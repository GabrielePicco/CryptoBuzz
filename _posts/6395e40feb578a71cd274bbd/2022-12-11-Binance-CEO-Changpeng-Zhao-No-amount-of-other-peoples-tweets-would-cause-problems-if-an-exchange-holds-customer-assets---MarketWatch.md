Perhaps it’s one last dagger, but Binance CEO Changpeng Zhou just could not resist a little dig at the fallen FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried.That’s a

## Highlights

- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhou could not resist a dig at the fallen FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried.
- He put in motion the seeds for FTX's collapse when he said he would sell FTT tokens, then valued at $2.1 billion, backing the exchange.
- That sent FTX customers scurrying, the token plunging, and triggered a very brief attempt by Binance to rescue FTX.
- Binance’s quick due diligence efforts are now more understandable in the light of the bankruptcy court filing from John Ray, who detailed the lack of even basic controls at FTX.
- He said balances of customer crypto assets deposited were not recorded as assets on the balance sheet.
