Ethereum 2.0 is becoming a reality with the Merge on Ropsten scheduled for June 8th. Amid the buzz, the experts share their thoughts

## Highlights

- The merge is scheduled to occur on June 8th, sparking a wave of excitement amongst community members.
- The merge will combine the beacon chain with the current mainnet.
- The Merge lays the foundation for Shard Chains, an answer to the network’s quest for scalability as operations will be spread across 64 different chains.
- Experts are particularly interested in the amount of energy that will be saved in a transition to Proof-of-Stake, especially as PoW systems like Bitcoin have caught a lot of flak for their impact on the environment.
- The merge has been hailed for its deflationary characteristics leading to “yield-starved investors”
