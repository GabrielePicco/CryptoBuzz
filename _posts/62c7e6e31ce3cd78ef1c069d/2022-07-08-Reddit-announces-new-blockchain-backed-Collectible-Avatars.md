## Highlights

- Reddit announced a new blockchain-backed avatars system on Thursday.
- The company said the avatars will be available to the general public in the next few weeks.
- The new avatars are a set of limited-edition artwork created by independent artists who are also users of the Reddit website.
- Artists will get paid for every Collectible Avatar that sells on Reddit, less any fees, and are also entitled to receive royalties from secondary sales of their Collectible Avatars on open marketplaces.
- The avatars can be purchased with local currencies, however the announcement stated the artwork is stored on the Polygon (MATIC) blockchain.
- In addition, management of the collectible avatars is handled through Vault, Reddit’s blockchain-powered wallet.
