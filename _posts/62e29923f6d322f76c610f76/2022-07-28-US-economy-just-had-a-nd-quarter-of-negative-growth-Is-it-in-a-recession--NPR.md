- economy shrank in the last three months by 0.9%.
- This is the second consecutive quarter where the economy has contracted.
- The White House has pushed back against calling the current economy a recession.
- But it's unclear how much Americans will care about whether the economy is in a recession, or it doesn't meet a specific, highly-technical definition.
- The National Bureau of Economic Research determines when the economy's economic activity is at a high level of recession.
