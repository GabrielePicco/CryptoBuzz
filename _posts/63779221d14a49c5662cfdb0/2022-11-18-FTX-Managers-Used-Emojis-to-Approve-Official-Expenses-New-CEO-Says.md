Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX made most decisions over online chat messages, which were set to auto-delete, new CEO John Ray said.

## Highlights

- New CEO John Ray said FTX employees claimed expenses through chat messages.
- Random managers would approve the claims by responding with emojis, Ray said in court filings.
- Ray: "Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such an absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here" FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried failed to keep communication, hiring, and financial records, the new CEO said.
- The exchange filed for bankruptcy on November 11, and around 130 affiliated companies have started bankruptcy proceedings.
- It used employees' personal names to purchase real estate in the Bahamas with corporate funds, according to Ray's report.
