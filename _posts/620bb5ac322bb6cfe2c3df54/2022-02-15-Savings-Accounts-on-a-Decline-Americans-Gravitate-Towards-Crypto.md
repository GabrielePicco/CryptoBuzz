- 24% of US citizens are holding cryptocurrencies, while only 23% had a savings account opened.
- 57% of those who held crypto were millennials.
- Brokerage accounts are still in the lead, though, with 31% of the population holding them.
- Unsurprisingly, crypto seems more popular with younger adults, as it presents an opportunity for immediate returns.

- It seems that the crypto support has been steadily growing over the past few months, especially with some big industry names endorsing it, such as Tesla, or Cashapp.
