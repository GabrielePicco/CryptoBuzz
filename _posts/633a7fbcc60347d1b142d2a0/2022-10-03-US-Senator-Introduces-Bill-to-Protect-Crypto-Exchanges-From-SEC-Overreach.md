A Republican Senator is introducing a new bill that would protect crypto exchange platforms from certain enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

## Highlights

- Bill Hagerty of Tennessee is pitching the Digital Clarity Act of 2022 as a means of shielding crypto exchanges from SEC overreach.
- The bill would provide regulatory clarity about how virtual assets are to be classified.
- Haggerty says that regulatory ambiguity is making investment and job creation difficult for crypto firms operating in the US, impeding the industry’s growth.
- No specific details were given as to which SEC enforcement actions would be covered by the bill to protect crypto exchanges.
- Earlier this year, HagerTY also introduced the Stablecoin Transparency Act, a bill that would clarify which crypto assets qualify as stablecoins and how they’re to be backed.
