\"Just because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn’t mean that it is,\" the SEC chair said.

## Highlights

- The proposal takes up Congress's 2010 provision for us to expand the custody rule to cover all of an investor’s assets, not just their funds or securities.
- The expanded custody rule would help ensure that advisers don’t inappropriately use, abuse, or lose investors’ assets," Gensler said in his remarks.
- "Just because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn't mean that it is," the SEC chair said in a statement on the proposal.
- The proposal was passed by Congress in 2010 after the financial crisis and Bernie Madoff's frauds, he said in an interview with CNN's John Sutter.
