The CEO of Algorand Foundation said Coinbase is evaluating its products and services after receiving a Wells Notice. A Coinbase spokesperson denies the claim.

## Highlights

- Algorand Foundation CEO Stacy Waden tweeted about decision to discontinue rewards for retail customers.
- The move follows a Wells notice issued by the U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission.
- A spokesperson for the crypto exchange says the move is not related to regulatory developments.
- The change does not affect the ALGO token trading and governance rewards for institutional investors, Waden added in the thread.
- The SEC reached an agreement with crypto exchange Kraken for “failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program,” which the commission claims qualified as securities under its purview.
