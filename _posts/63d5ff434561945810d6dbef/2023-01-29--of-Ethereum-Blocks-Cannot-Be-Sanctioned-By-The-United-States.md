OFAC has been tightening its regulations on cryptocurrency transactions and actively monitoring the Ethereum network for any illegal activities.

## Highlights

- The United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has been monitoring the Ethereum network for any illegal activities.
- OFAC is a U.S.
- government agency that is responsible for enforcing economic and trade sanctions against countries and individuals that are deemed to be a threat to the national security of the United States.
- OFAC has been using advanced analytics tools to scan the blockchain for transactions that match the criteria of known sanctions targets.
- This has led to a situation where only 33% of all Ethereum blocks cannot be sanctioned by OFAC.
- This is a significant problem for the community as it means that a large portion of their transactions is at risk of being blocked or frozen.
