With regulators quickly clamping down on crypto, Coinbase seeks to foster grassroots support for the industry and influence politicians to be more welcoming of it.

## Highlights

- Coinbase has announced a grassroots initiative to expand pro-crypto advocacy to citizens across all 435 Congressional Districts.
- The company claims that Crypto435 will “influence laws and policies,” and also “educate everyday Americans about the power of crypto’s power.
- The initiative presents an opportunity for lovers of crypto and web 3 to make their opinions known in Washington.
- Congress has yet to pass any new laws clearing the air on how to classify cryptocurrencies or determine which agencies should oversee them.
- The SEC has been cracking down on the industry, particularly over the staking-as-a-service product and staking services and tokens.
