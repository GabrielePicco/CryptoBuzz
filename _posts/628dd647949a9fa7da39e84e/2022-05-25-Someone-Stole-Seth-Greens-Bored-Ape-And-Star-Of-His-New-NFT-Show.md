The actor has been pleading on Twitter with “DarkWing84,” who bought his ape from a scammer, to return it.

## Highlights

- Seth Green's Bored Ape was sold for $42,000 by a scammer.
- Green has appealed to the scammer to return the ape to his new owner.
- NFT copyright law can be “a particularly thorny issue,” a legal expert said.
- Green responded on Twitter to allegations about what the stolen ape means for the future of his show.
- A growing number of NFT projects are granting owners the right to commercially adapt their works, which has been a useful strategy for increasing brand visibility but has consequently introduced a host of legal disputes.
- It's unclear if buyers of stolen NFTs knew the ape was illicitly obtained when they purchased it
