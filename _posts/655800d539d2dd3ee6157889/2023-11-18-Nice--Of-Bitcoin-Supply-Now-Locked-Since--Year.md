On-chain data shows that the percentage of the Bitcoin supply inactive since at least one year ago has hit the 69% mark.

## Highlights

- On-chain data shows that the percentage of the Bitcoin supply inactive since at least one year ago has hit the 69% mark.
- An all-time high (ATH) amount of the BTC supply hasn’t moved in over a year.
- The longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to move them at any point.
- Currently, most of the asset’s supply falls under this category, and it has only continued to grow recently.
- With coins being effectively locked out of the selling supply to an ATH degree, it would be interesting to see how the ongoing Bitcoin rally plays out from here.
- Bitcoin is trading at around $36,800, down 2% in the past week.
