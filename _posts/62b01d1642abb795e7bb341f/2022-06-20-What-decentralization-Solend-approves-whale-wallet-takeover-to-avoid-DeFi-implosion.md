Crypto is in a precarious place and Solend’s attempt to force liquidate a DeFi user’s wallet puts the sector and its reputation in an even tougher situation.

## Highlights

- Solend, a popular DeFi protocol on Solana (SOL), put together a governance proposal related to one of the whale wallets at risk of liquidation.
- The proposal, dubbed “SLND1 : Mitigate Risk From Whale,” was abruptly launched on Sunday without announcement and the vote closed with a 97% approval rating.
- The scandal comes on the heels of last week’s sudden layoffs from Coinbase and BlockFi, and the liquidation debacle of Three Arrows Capital.
- The move shows that crypto is not as “decentralized” as its users may have thought, says Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs.
