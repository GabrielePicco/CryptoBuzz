Swiss citizens will get the chance to try to ensure their economy never becomes cashless, a pressure group said, after collecting enough signatures by Monday to trigger a popular vote on the issue.

## Highlights

- The FBS (FBS) says cash is playing a role in many countries.
- It wants to ensure that a "sufficient quantity" of banknotes or coins remain in circulation.
- There is no evidence of moves towards a cashless society by Swiss citizens.
- The proposal would become law if approved by the Swiss parliament, though the government would decide how that law was implemented.
- The public has been asked to sign up to vote on the issue, but it is unlikely to do so.
- It is the first time a law has been passed by the public in the last five years that the public will vote on such a change in the rule of law.
