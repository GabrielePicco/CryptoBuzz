June was the largest outflow month for bitcoin leaving exchanges, bringing the remaining balance across exchanges to about 2.4 million bitcoin.

## Highlights

- June quietly was the largest month of net withdrawals in recorded history for bitcoin.
- The total amount of bitcoin across these exchanges at the time of writing is 2,400,178 BTC, equating to $49.35 billion and approximately 12.58% of circulating supply.
- The remaining remaining balance across exchanges is about 2.4 million bitcoin, bringing the remaining balance to about 2,000,000 BTC.
- It will be interesting to see if the trend of decreasing exchange balances accelerates given the vast amount of counterparty risk that the crypto industry was exposed to over recent months.
- Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter, is now publishing an exclusive analysis of the latest bitcoin market analysis.
