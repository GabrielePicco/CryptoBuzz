Thanks to an NFT project called VanityBlocks, anyone can own the final piece of Ethereum's history as a proof-of-work blockchain.

## Highlights

- The final proof-of-work (PoW) block was turned into art in the early hours of Thursday morning.
- The final PoW block contains a single transaction that is used to mint a VanityBlock NFT.
- The NFT’s creators paid 30 ETH (roughly $50,000) for the privilege of capping out the 30 million gas limit and creating the final transaction.
- "The Last POW Block" NFT is being auctioned on OpenSea, where it has already attracted a bid of 10 ETH, or $16,118.10 at today's price.
- The project materialized through “smoking weed and chatting with friends on Whatsapp”
