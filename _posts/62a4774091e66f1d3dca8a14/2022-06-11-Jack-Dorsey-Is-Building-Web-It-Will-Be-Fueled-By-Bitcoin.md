- Dorsey stepped down as CEO of Twitter in November 2021, has explored a number of Bitcoin-related projects, the most recent of which is named “Web5” Dorsey may be motivated to pursue a new web development model because he believes Web3 will never reach complete decentralization.
- In December 2021, Dorsey stated that the venture capital community that supports Web3 have been publicly chastised by the Block CEO.
- “It will never escape their incentives.
- It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label” says the author of the concept.
