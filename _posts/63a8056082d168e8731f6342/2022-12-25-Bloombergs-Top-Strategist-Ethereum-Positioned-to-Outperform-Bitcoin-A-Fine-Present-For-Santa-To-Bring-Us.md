## Highlights

- Bloomberg's senior macro strategist Mike McGlone says Bitcoin and other risk assets have deflated considerably in the past year.
- The pundit noted in Bloomberg’s latest market outlook report that Ethereum exhibited more resilience, suggesting that it “may be a top candidate to continue outperforming the firstborn crypto” since hitting all-time highs in November 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped roughly 76% and 75% respectively.
- In 2021, the market dominance of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose as high as 22%, suggesting it could “Flippen” Bitcoin at some point, according to the pundit.
