One user associated the string of deaths with a mafia-style hit job and said that the crypto world is taking a page from the mafia handbook.

## Highlights

- Four crypto billionaires died mysteriously in less than a month.
- The deaths occurred under suspicious circumstances.
- Reddit users have speculated that the deaths may be linked to a mafia-style hit job.
- A similar saga erupted in May 2020 when the CEO of defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX mysteriously died during a visit to India.
- Redditors speculated that they may not have actually died at all, with one writing, “I wonder how many of these are people faking their own deaths.” Another user speculated the billionaires might be living under fake names and are using their ‘deaths” to start a new chapter of their life.
