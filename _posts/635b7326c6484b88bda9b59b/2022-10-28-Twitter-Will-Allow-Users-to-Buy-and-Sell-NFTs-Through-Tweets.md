Twitter will let users display NFT marketplace listings from certain platforms, including a button to let them buy and sell collectibles.

## Highlights

- Twitter will let users display NFTs directly through tweets in partnership with four marketplaces.
- The integration, called NFT Tweet Tiles, displays the artwork of an NFT in a dedicated panel within a tweet.
- The feature is currently being tested with select Twitter users across iOS and web, and is still in testing.
- A Twitter Blue premium subscription is not required to use the feature, but it currently only supports ETHICNTSs.
- Twitter previously supported NFT photos as verified profile pictures through its Twitter Blue subscription service in January, but the feature is now only supported by ETHicNTSes and other blockchains in limited use.
