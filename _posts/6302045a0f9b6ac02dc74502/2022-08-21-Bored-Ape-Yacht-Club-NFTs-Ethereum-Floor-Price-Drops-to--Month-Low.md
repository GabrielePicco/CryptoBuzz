The Ethereum floor price of the biggest NFT collection has slipped to its lowest level since the start of the year.

## Highlights

- Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT NFT floor price has dropped to 65.68 ETH, its lowest level since January 2, 2022.
- Bored Apes acquired using loans on peer-to-peer lending service BenDAO could face liquidations.
- BAYC floor price is around $107,000 today; substantially lower than at the start of the year, when it was just under $256,000, but up from a low of $87,000 in June.
- NFTs that operate on the Ether network and are sold for Ether tend to shadow the price of the value of the rest of the crypto market.
