Most experts still aren't ready to declare a recession is around the corner, but Fed Chair Powell has grown increasingly cautious in warning of the economic consequences of higher interest rates.

## Highlights

- Fed Chair Powell warns economy will suffer as the central bank works to ease inflation.
- Powell didn't mention the likelihood of Fed policy causing a recession, but Oanda analyst Ed Moya says the speech showed the Fed is "committed to restrictive policy that will eventually get this economy into a recession" Goldman Sachs economists place the odds of a recession over the next year at one in three, but others, including Nomura, believe one will start later this year.
- Despite widespread reports of layoffs and hiring freezes, the economy posted impressive job growth for July, with more than half a million jobs added.
- The Fed's most closely watched inflation indicator cooled at the slowest pace in more than a year last month, according to Friday morning data.
