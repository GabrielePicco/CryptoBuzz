The Mango robbery is the latest example of DeFi hackers claiming their behavior is fair game.

## Highlights

- A hacker last week stole $114 million from a Solana-trading platform called Mango Markets.
- The hacker, Avraham Eisenberg, is unrepentant and described the robbery as a “highly profitable trading strategy” that was allowed by Mango’s code.
- Critics object to not only what he did but to his greed—keeping far more than would be awarded as part of a typical “bug bounty” program that rewards hackers for pointing out software vulnerabilities.
- Tether has frozen nearly $500 million of its stablecoin, likely in response to law enforcement demands; Tether may still be earning interest on the funds.
