Bitcoin shows its use as a fiat exit in the U.K. with the pound sterling still targeting dollar parity.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) will see increased interest from the United Kingdom “very quickly” as volatility makes BTC look like a stablecoin.
- Gabor Gurbacs, strategy adviser at investment giant VanEck, flagged Bitcoin’s appeal over the pound this week.
- The pound's disintegration gathered pace this week as GBP/USD hit its lowest on record at nearly $1.03.
- G20 countries could yet enact a major policy shift vis-a-vis BTC acceptance, says Gaboracs.
- The longer the time horizon, the more attractive a Bitcoin hedge becomes, G20 is “starting to understand” the need for a BTC hedge, he said.
