## Highlights

- Bitcoin wallets of small and medium size have recently bought a large amount of BTC.
- In the past half year, they have accumulated around 9% of their holdings to their stashes.

- Overall, since Bitcoin hit a historic peak in November last year, these addresses have sold a cumulative $10.75 billion.
