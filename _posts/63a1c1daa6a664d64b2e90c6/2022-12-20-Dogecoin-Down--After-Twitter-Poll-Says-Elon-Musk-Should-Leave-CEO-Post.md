The once ascendant OG meme coin was long speculated to be a part of a planned Twitter-based wallet integration.

## Highlights

- The price of Dogecoin dropped more than 10% today and is currently trading at $0.07.
- The original meme coin had seen its price pump since the one-time richest man in the world bought Twitter in October.
- Elon Musk has taken to Twitter to gauge community views on various Twitter policies, including reinstating once-banned accounts and now whether he should step down as the head of the social media platform.
- The crypto market and broader tech industry have taken a pounding recently due to fears of a recession and the collapse of several prominent companies, including FTX.
- Bitcoin, the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all down one to two percent today.
