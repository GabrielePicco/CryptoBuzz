Co-founder Aaron Davis says in his first joint interview with Dan Finlay that \"it feels too little too late, but putting your money in cryptocurrencies is gambling.\"

## Highlights

- MetaMask co-founders Aaron Davis and Dan Finlay see issues in the crypto space but still believe in its potential.
- MetaMask launched in 2016 as part of a broader push within ConsenSys, an influential tech company dedicated to funding crypto projects and developing applications and services for the Ethereum blockchain.
- But Finlay also laid blame for many of the most public failures such as the bankruptcies of the brokerage Voyager and loan company Celsius on bad actors who were not acting in line with the crypto ethos of transparency.
- Finlay: “It’s by definition impossible for us to wrap the whole thing into a unified bow and enforce it in a direction”
