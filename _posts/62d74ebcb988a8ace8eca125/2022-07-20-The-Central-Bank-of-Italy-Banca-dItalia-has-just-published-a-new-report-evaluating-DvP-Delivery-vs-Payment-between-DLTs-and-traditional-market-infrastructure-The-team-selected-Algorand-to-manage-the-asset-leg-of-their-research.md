DvP, TIPS, DLT

## Highlights

- The rise of a market for digital assets is closely linked with the growing diffusion of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) platforms among investors.
- Increasing volume of transactions involving digital assets makes it worthwhile to investigate how central bank money can contribute to make the settlement safer and more efficient.
- This requires the identification of possible solutions to increase interoperability between currently independent infrastructures: those regulating the exchange of the digital assets and those providing central bank settlement services.
- This implies building a "bridge" between DLT platforms and market infrastructureures, which need to be directly connected to interact with each other to allow these transactions to flow through the market.
