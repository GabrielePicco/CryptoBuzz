## Highlights

- Two billionaire crypto evangelists funded a 12-week “Bitcoin Academy” for residents of a public housing complex in Brooklyn.
- Three months later, class has been dismissed, and tenants at the Marcy Houses have very different opinions about the whole affair.

- One alumna said she has already started moving some of her other assets into crypto, with plans to buy more with every paycheck.
