Labeling an asset a security changes nothing fundamental about the asset. We should stop pretending it does.

## Highlights

- Bitcoiners are celebrating regulation, it’s more useful to think about whether regulation even matters.
- The SEC's mandate to enforce laws against market manipulation to protect investors is a valiant purpose.
- Labeling an asset a security changes nothing fundamental about the asset, he says.
- We should stop pretending it does, he writes, and it doesn’t matter whether bitcoin, ether, SOL, dogecoin or AVAX are deemed securities, he adds.
- He says the SEC is trying to enforce its mandate to prevent market manipulation in the context of securities, but it's wrong to think that this is a matter of whether it matters.
