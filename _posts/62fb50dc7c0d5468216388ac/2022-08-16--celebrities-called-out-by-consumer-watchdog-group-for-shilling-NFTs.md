A consumer watchdog group has called out 19 different celebrities for allegedly promoting NFTs without disclosing their connection to the projects.

## Highlights

- Consumer watchdog group Truth in Advertising (TINA.org) has called out 19 celebrities for allegedly promoting nonfungible tokens (NFTs) without disclosing their connection to the projects.
- NFTs are digital certificates stored on the blockchain proving ownership of a digital or physical asset, often an artwork, with many high-profile projects attracting celebrity endorsement and promotion.
- No real legal penalty has been attached, but the group sent letters to the celebrities urging them to immediately disclose any connections they have to NFT companies or brands they have promoted, stating: “The promoter often fails to disclose material connection to... the endorsed NFT company”
