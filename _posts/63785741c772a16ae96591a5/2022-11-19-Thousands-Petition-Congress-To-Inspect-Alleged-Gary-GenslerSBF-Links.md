John Deaton’s CryptoLaw website features a petition app, and visitors request Congress to investigate supposedly questionable Gensler–SBF links.

## Highlights

- Nearly 4,000 people have used a petition app to urge Congress to investigate Gary Gensler's role in the FTX fraud.
- Members of Congress have already been informed that the SEC chairman was working with FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to give FTX a regulatory free pass while a massive fraud was going on right under the SEC’s nose, according to a petition.
- The suspected connections between the bankrupt FTX and SBF 'SBF' began to gain notice immediately after the disreputable exchange's problems became public.
- Republican Representative Tom Emmer tweeted on November 10 that “reports to my office allege he [Gensler] was helping SBF and FTX work on legal loopholes to obtain a regulatory monopoly”
