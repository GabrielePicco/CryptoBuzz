The once “ground-breaking” technology is down 99% from its all-time highs. NFTs exploded in popularity in 2021, and that continued well into 2022. There were absurd stories of people buying JPEGs worth the price of literal mansions. Thousands of celebrities hopped on the bandwagon, shilling what inevitably always turned out to be scam projects (and unregistered securities) to their audiences, only to delete it all a month later and act like it didn’t happen.

## Highlights

- The once “ground-breaking” technology is down 99% from its all-time highs.
- At its highs, OpenSea had $2.7 billion in trading volume.
- Even some of the largest NFT games like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox are quickly dying.

- NFTs have consistently failed to find a use case and the fact that every transaction costs money is going to deter the overwhelming majority of people from using them for simple transactions.
