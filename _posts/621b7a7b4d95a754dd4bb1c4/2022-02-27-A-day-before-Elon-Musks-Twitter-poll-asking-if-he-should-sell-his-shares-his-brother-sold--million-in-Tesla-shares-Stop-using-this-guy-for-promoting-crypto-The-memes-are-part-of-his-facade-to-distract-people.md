Kimbal Musk saved about $18 million by selling 88,500 Tesla shares the day before Elon's Twitter poll, instead of selling the following day.

## Highlights

- The SEC is investigating whether Tesla stock trades made by Elon Musk and his brother, Kimbal Musk, violated insider trading rules.
- Kimbal sold $108 million worth of Tesla stock just one day before Elon asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake to pay taxes.
- Tesla stock immediately fell 12% after the Twitter poll, and Elon went on to sell $16 billion worth of shares.
- The SEC's investigation into Kimbal and Elon could end without the agency making formal allegations of wrongdoing, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.
- Tesla has had a long running feud with the SEC since Elon was investigated for fraud related to his "funding secured" at $420 per share tweet in 2018.
