As per regulatory filings, the trader’s business increased its profit by 1,404.12% in 2021, compared to the year before.

## Highlights

- Darren Nguyen, 25, traded AU$10.41 million ($7.1 million) in after-tax profit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
- This came from a total of AU$2.98 billion ($2 million) worth of crypto trading over the 12-month period.
- It was a huge increase from the previous year’s takings, which totaled around AU$692,182 ($470,780) in 2020.
- The Australian publication suggested that PO Street Capital was self-funded to conduct such a high amount of trades at AU$3 billion.
- However, with the markets down since then, it is unclear how that has impacted Nguyen and his business.
