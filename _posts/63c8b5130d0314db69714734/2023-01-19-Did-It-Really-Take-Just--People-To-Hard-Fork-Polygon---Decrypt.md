The manner in which Polygon's leadership navigated a recent upgrade has some questioning its commitment to decentralization.

## Highlights

- Polygon successfully completed a network hard fork Tuesday.
- The network's leadership proposed a hard fork to reduce the sprint length of on-chain transactions and reduce the frequency of chain reorganizations, or “reorgs” Polygon’s Governance Team set forth an initial proposal to implement a fork in December.
- But only 15 of the network's 100 validators voted on the proposal.
- Polygon's leadership has in the past publicly likened itself to a cadrevolent dictators, some questioning its commitment to decentralization.
- A source familiar with the matter told Decrypt that a number of Polygon validators may not have even registered for the forum where Polygon tallies such a vote was taking place.
