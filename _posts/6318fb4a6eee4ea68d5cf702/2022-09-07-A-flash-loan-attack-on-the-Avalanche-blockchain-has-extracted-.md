Flash loan attack on Avalanche detected by blockchain cybersecurity firm CertiK via its Skynet software tool

## Highlights

- Flash loan attack on Avalanche blockchain has extracted $370,000 in USDC from a smart contract.
- Decentralized exchange Trader Joe, staking platform Nereus Finance and automated market maker Curve Finance are thought to have been impacted.
- The identity of the attacker, as in the majority of cases involving flash loan exploits, remains unknown.
- Flash loan exploit is an abuse of a smart contracts security whereby a nefarious actor typically borrows uncollateralized funds from a lending protocol and manipulates the price of a given asset, driving up its value.
- The attacker then sells back the borrowed capital in the same transaction after theyâ€™ve managed to arbitrage the asset, pocketing the difference.
