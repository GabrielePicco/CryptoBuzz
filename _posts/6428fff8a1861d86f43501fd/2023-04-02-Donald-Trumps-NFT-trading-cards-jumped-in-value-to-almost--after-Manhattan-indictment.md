Trump's campaign on Friday also said it had raised more than $4 million from grassroots supporters within 24 hours following news of the indictment.

## Highlights

- Trump's digital trading card NFTs soared in value to nearly $1,700 USD following his indictment.
- Trump became the first former president to face criminal charges when a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict him on Thursday.
- Trump is likely to surrender to the Manhattan DA's office on Tuesday, his attorney previously told Insider.
- Trump's campaign on Friday also said it had raised more than $4 million within 24 hours following news of the indictment, signaling "that the American people see the indictment of President Trump as a disgraceful weaponization of our justice system by a Soros-funded prosecutor," his campaign said in a press conference on April 1.
