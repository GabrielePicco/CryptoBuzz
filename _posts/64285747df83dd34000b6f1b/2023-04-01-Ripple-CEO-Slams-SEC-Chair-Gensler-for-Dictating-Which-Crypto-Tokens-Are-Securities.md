Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has slammed SEC Chair Gary Gensler for dictating which crypto tokens are securities.

## Highlights

- Ripple CEO slams SEC Chair Gary Gensler for dictating which crypto tokens are securities.
- Brad Garlinghouse has slammed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman for claiming that he has the authority to determine what is a security rather than relying on the legislation that governs his agency’s power.
- “When you behave like an autocrat running a $2.2B bloated agency, why would you ever want to provide clarity about what's ‘in or out’?
- Without clear jurisdiction, ambiguity masquerades as power,” the Ripple executive stressed.
- The SEC has repeatedly expressed the view that all crypto tokens, apart from bitcoin, are considered securities.
