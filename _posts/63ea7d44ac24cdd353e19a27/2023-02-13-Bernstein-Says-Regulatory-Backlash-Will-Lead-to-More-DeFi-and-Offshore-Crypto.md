Regulatory overreach will lead to further movement towards decentralized finance apps, built directly on-chain by anonymous teams, the report said.

## Highlights

- Bernstein says a decision by the regulator to prohibit all staking programs may not be straightforward.
- Some firms could decide to fight against the regulatory stance.
- The broker notes that the crypto industry still argues that the â€œabsence of crypto-specific guidance or regulation will continue hurting even the good players, who choose to offer transparent staking services, which by itself would not classify as a security, under the Howey Test.
- Regulatory overreach will lead to further movement towards decentralized finance apps, built directly on-chain by anonymous teams, the report said.
