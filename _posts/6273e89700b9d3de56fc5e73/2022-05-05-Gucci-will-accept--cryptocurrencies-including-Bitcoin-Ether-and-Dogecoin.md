Gucci will initially accept 10 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, and Dogecoin

## Highlights

- Customers in some stores in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Atlanta and Las Vegas will be able to pay using digital tokens from the end of May.
- Gucci, owned by Kering SA, will initially accept 10 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.
- Decision to embrace crypto payments shows how luxury brands are trying to appeal to younger generations of consumers by catering to emerging trends, such as creating outfits for digital characters.
- But not all luxury groups are convinced of the risk of “hype” around the metaverse, saying it could be a way to make “easy money”
