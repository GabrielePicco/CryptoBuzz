Read now to learn how Bitcoin is much more immune to 51% attacks than you may have been led to believe.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin is the only decentralized blockchain in existence, and Bitcoin has the strongest network in the space.
- However, some question whether Bitcoin’s proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism is as secure as other consensus mechanisms.
- An attack against Bitcoin would quickly bankrupt the attacker.
- Attacking Bitcoin for even one hour would cost billions of dollars, since an attacker would have to buy enough computers to command 51% of Bitcoin's hash rate, not to mention electricity to power them all.
- And if the attacker should succeed in destroying Bitcoin, all those costs would be expended at a complete loss, since the Bitcoin earned from mining or Bitcoin used to double spend would be worthless.
