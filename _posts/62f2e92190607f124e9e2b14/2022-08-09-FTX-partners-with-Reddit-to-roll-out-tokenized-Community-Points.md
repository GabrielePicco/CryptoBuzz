FTX has partnered with Reddit to help today's online communities become truly independent platforms - all with the help of blockchain technology.

## Highlights

- FTX has partnered with Reddit to help today's online communities become truly independent platforms with the help of blockchain technology.
- Community Points are ERC-20 tokens on the Arbitrum Nova blockchain.
- The more Points someone earns, the more influence they will have within that space.
- Points will initially roll out on the r/CryptoCurrency and r/FortnightBR subreddits.
- Once earned through active engagement and other activities, you can view your Points within the Reddit Vault wallet on mobile or web, and collect airdrops by paying an Ethereum network fee, or “gas funds”.
- Once Points are used, they are then burned and removed from circulation.
