Stripe continues its crypto endeavors with a new pilot program that will let some Twitter users get paid in the popular stablecoin USDC.

## Highlights

- Stripe is launching a pilot program to let some Twitter users get paid in stablecoin USDC.
- Payouts will be executed on the speedy crypto network Polygon and will only support Circleâ€™s USDC stablecoin at first.
- Twitter users included in the pilot will be allowed to opt-in to receive their payouts in USDC.
- They can then bridge them to the Ethereum blockchain or simply hodl on Polygon.
- Twitter's Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces are expected to integrate the pilot.
- The pilot offering also comes roughly a month after the firm began servicing crypto companies.
