Four top Coinbase executives have netted close to $1.2 billion in proceeds by selling their COIN holdings from when the company went public in April 2021,

## Highlights

- Four top Coinbase executives have sold $1.2 billion worth of COIN shares since the company went public in April 2021.
- Co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, its President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi, and Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee sold their shares at prices ranging from $189 to $422.
- At the time of writing, COIN is trading at $73, signifying an 80% decrement in value since its public listing.
- COIN's daily MACD, MFI, and RSI hint at an oversold scenario that could assist in the stock moving towards the 50-day moving average.
- But caution is advised going long on COIN given that the US Fed plans to initiate Quantitative Tightening beginning June 1st, which is next week
