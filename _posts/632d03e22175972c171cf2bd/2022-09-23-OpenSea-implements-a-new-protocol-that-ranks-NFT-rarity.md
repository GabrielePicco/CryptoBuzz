Creators can decide if they want to choose to apply the feature to their collections or not with the new OpenSea feature.

## Highlights

- NFT marketplace OpenSea announced the implementation of OpenRarity, a protocol that provides verifiable rarity calculations for nonfungible tokens.
- The goal is to standardize the rarity methodology and provide consistent rarity rankings across all NFT platforms.
- Rare NFTs will be awarded lower numbers like 1 or 2, while others that have attributes similar to many others will have higher numbers.
- Creators can decide if they want to apply the feature to their collections or not with the new OpenSea feature.
- The feature will not be automatically applied to all of the NFT collections, according to the marketplace.
- The marketplace also recently launched an initiative that lets creators make their own NFT drop pages that they can customize.
