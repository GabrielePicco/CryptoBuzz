In some areas, such as the corporate world, women have been striving for parity with men for quite some time now. In others, such as the world of digital assets and cryptocurrency, they are starting to close the gap.

## Highlights

- Women make up more than half of investors in the £1,000-£5,000 range in the UK.
- This is an encouraging sign for the industry, as it shows that women are becoming more involved in cryptocurrency.
- Several women are in positions of authority throughout the crypto ecosystem, and their voices must be heard to create a more inclusive community.
- There is still a long way to go in terms of achieving gender parity in the cryptocurrency industry, according to BanklessTimes.com CEO Jonathan Merry.
- The industry must continue educating women about digital assets and their potential to achieve true gender parity, he says.
- If this trend continues, it could significantly impact the future of the industry.
