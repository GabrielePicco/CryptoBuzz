Before suspending withdrawals and filing for insolvency, Celsius's executives, as well as Alex Mashinsky's wife, cashed out millions.

## Highlights

- Celsius Network Ltd.
- cashed out at least $17 million in digital tokens before suspending withdrawals and filing for insolvency.
- Ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky's wife appears to have taken out $2 million in the CEL token just before the suspension of withdrawals in June and bankruptcy filing in July.
- Celsius has also been accused by the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation of hiding its financial woes from the investors and engaging in the “improper manipulation of the price” of its tokens to improve its balance sheet.
- The last bid deadline for Celsius will be on October 17 at 4 p.m., and an auction will be held, if required, on October 20 at 10 a.m.
