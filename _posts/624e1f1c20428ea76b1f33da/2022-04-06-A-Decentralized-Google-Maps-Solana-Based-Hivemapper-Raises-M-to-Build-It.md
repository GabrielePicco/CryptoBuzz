Hivemapper rewards users with tokens for passively capturing mapping data with dashcams in a model inspired by Helium.

## Highlights

- Hivemapper, a decentralized digital mapping network, has raised a $18M Series A. The network rewards users with Solana-based crypto tokens for capturing dashcam data.
- Founder and CEO Ariel Seidman was Yahooâ€™s director of product management on Yahoo Maps in the late aughts when Google surged into the pole position in the mapping space.
- He realized that only well-funded, centralized juggernauts could hope to compete going forward, given the expensive and time-consuming task of constantly updating high-quality digital maps.
- Eventually, he hopes to provide an alternative to the maps provided by tech giants like Google, TomTom, and Apple.
