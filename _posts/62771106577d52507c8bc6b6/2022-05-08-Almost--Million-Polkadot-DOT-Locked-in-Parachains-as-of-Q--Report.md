The leading web3 protocol's latest launch of XCM (cross-consensus messaging) will optimize cross-chain communication, the report noted.

## Highlights

- Polkadot has successfully completed 13 parachain slot auctions, with a total of 127.8 million DOT – worth $2.9 billion - bonded.
- The active and new accounts have decreased in the same period, but the growth of parachains confirms the steady progress of the ecosystem.
- The report said interest in the ecosystem had declined after users flooded for partaking in the parachain auction in November.
- It concluded the network’s developer activity remains at the top tier in crypto, trailing only to Etherum, and the network's main wallet has been criticized by users for its general functionalities.
- The report also pointed out that the uniqueness of the architecture has led to misunderstandings and misconceptions that deter a wider adoption
