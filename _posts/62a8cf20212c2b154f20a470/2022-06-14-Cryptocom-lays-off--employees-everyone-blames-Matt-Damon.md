Does fortune still favor the brave?

## Highlights

- Some Twitter users are putting the blame squarely on Bitcoin.com's spokesperson Matt Damon.
- The actor was a spokesperson for the website in a highly-publicized commercial.
- One writer laid out exactly how much Bitcoin has become devalued today compared to when the commercial first aired, which is quite a bit.
- One Twitter user made a metaphorical connection between the rate at which Bitcoin prices are currently plummeting and the speed at which Matthew McConaughey slid down a glacier on an icy planet after being pushed off of a cliff by Damon’s character in Interstellar.
- Another Twitter user said, “I was assured by Matt Damon that such a thing would not happen.”
