Crypto industry titans explain why now is the time to buy into any weakness as bitcoin becomes part of national security discussions.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin is becoming part of national security discussions given the surge in demand in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- Bitcoin is finally showing itself to be an "emerging store of value" in the face of uncertainty.
- Investors are doing themselves a disservice by looking at short-term correlations to make sense of the asset class, Bitwise's Matt Hougan said.
- Bitcoin cannot be treated as an inflation hedge, says Bitwise chief investment officer.
- The war has instigated a tectonic shift that will form the foundations of a multi-decade crypto bull run in time to come, says QCP Capital's Mark Yusko.
- Yusko: "It's time to go to one bitcoin to one bull fund"
