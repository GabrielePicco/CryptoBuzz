Kenya's interior ministry said on Wednesday that it had suspended the local activities of cryptocurrency project Worldcoin while government agencies assess potential risks to public safety.

## Highlights

- Kenya's government suspends activities of cryptocurrency project Worldcoin.
- The project requires users to give their iris scans in exchange for a digital ID.
- In some countries users also get free cryptocurrency as part of plans to create a new "identity and financial network" Local media have reported that more than 350,000 had signed up for the project as of Tuesday.
- Worldcoin Foundation, a Cayman Islands-based foundation, said it would take the time of suspension to boost understanding of privacy measures it has in place in Kenya and elsewhere it has a presence in the country.
- It has also come under scrutiny in Britain, Germany, France and France.
