Bitcoin wealth distribution continues to trend down, suggesting that more and more individuals are accumulating wealth, bringing down the Gini coefficient.

## Highlights

- Over the past week, the number of Bitcoin wallet addresses containing one BTC or more increased by 13,091.
- The total number of “wholecoiners” surged to 865,254.
- The number of whole coiners has rocketed during the downward price action, highlighted by the hockey stick growth on the Glassnode graph:Since June 10, the orange line has jumped.
- As there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin mined, each of these wallet addresses will own 1/21,000,000 of all Bitcoin.
- By inference, "whale" wallets (large BTC wallet addresses) could be unloading their bags.
