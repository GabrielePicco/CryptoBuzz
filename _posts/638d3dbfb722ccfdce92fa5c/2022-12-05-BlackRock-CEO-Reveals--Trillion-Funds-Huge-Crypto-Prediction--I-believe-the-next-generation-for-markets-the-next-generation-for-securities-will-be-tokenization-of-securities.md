The CEO of BlackRock has predicted crypto's blockchain technology will usher in \"the next generation for markets\"...

## Highlights

- Bitcoin BTC, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies have suffered an almighty crash this year (though Elon Musk sent one small cryptocurrency sharply higher).
- Now, the CEO of BlackRock BLK has predicted crypto's blockchain technology will usher in "the next generation for markets" The bitcoin price has crashed by around 70% since late last year, plunging under $17,000 per bitcoin and dragging down the ethereum price and raising fears the entire crypto market could be "headed for oblivion" BlackRock's Larry Fink warned many of today's biggest cryptocurrencies and crypto companies won't survive, pointing to the collapsed FTX crypto exchange as at odds with "whole foundation of what crypto is"
