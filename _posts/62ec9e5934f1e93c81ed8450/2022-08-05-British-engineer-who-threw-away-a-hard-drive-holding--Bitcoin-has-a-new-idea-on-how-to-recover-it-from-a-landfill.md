Back in 2013, James Howells's life changed when he threw out a hard drive that may just be the most valuable in the world. Before doing so,...

## Highlights

- British computer engineer James Howells has been trying to excavate the key to his Bitcoin wallet from a local landfill for nine years.
- The wallet still holds the equivalent of almost $185 million in digital tokens.
- Howells asked Newport's city council to allow him to dig for it in a landfill, but they have turned down his requests.
- This year, he came up with the boldest project yet, but the chances of it getting approved by authorities are slim to none.
- After excavating the garbage, Howells plans to clean and recycle as much of it as possible, while the rest would be reburied.
- He is also exploring the feasibility of building a solar or wind power plant on top of the landfill site.
