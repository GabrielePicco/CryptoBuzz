The federal regulator has continued to double down on crypto enforcement actions, most recently suing the company SafeMoon and its executives.

## Highlights

- The Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the major federal regulators looking to rein in the crypto industry.
- A new report from the SEC’s inspector general cites a “small candidate pool of qualified experts” and competition with alluring offers from the private sector.
- The report also cited candidates’ conflicts with rules that prohibit the holding of cryptocurrencies.
- The regulator has doubled down on enforcement actions since the collapse of the FTX in November 2022, filing a series of lawsuits against companies and personalities, both big and small.
- In June, he picked fights with the two of the biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and then Coinbase, in addition to suing the company SafeMoon.
