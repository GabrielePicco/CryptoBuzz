Sunday’s sales total was over 99% lower than December’s peak day as the short-lived bubble of demand for Trump NFTs has well and truly popped.

## Highlights

- Donald Trump's NFT trading cards have slumped to new lows as trading demand continues to vanish.
- The NFT Trading Cards project launched less than a month ago, and the initial hype was sizable but short-lived.
- On Sunday, trading volume for the project hit a new daily low of just over $21,000.
- Sunday’s tally marks a more than 99% decrease in daily volume from the peak day on December 17, when more than $3.5 million worth of the NFTs were traded soon after the original primary sale.
- The price of the cheapest-listed NFT on a marketplace has dropped from a high of about 0.84 ETH ($995) to just $215 ($215) today.
