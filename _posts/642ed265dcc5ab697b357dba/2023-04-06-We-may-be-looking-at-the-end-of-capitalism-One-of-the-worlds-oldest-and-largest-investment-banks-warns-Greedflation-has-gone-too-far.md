Société Générale’s Albert Edwards says “something seems to have broken with capitalism.”

## Highlights

- Albert Edwards, a global strategist at the 159-year-old bank Société Générale, just released a blistering note on the phenomenon that has come to be called Greedflation.
- After four decades of working in finance, Edwards wrote that he’s never seen anything like the “unprecedented” and “astonishing” levels of corporate Greed inflation in this economic cycle.
- He added that he fears the ‘super-normal profit margins” of corporations in the U.S.
- and abroad could eventually “inflame social unrest” if consumers continue to struggle with inflation.
