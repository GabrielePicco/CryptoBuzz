Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge for permission to pay its top restructuring lawyers as much as $2,165 per hour, an unusually high rate for a company that cannot afford to repay all of its debts.

## Highlights

- FTX declared bankruptcy on Nov.
- 11, collapsing amid a wave of customer withdrawals.
- Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is charged with stealing billions of dollars in FTX customer assets to plug losses at his hedge fund.
- FTX's new CEO John Ray also filed an application with the court late Wednesday.
- Court-approved billing rates for bankruptcy attorneys did not cross the $2,000-per-hour mark until earlier this year in the bankruptcy of cosmetics giant Revlon.
- Experts say total legal fees in such a case as complex as FTX can exceed $100 million.
