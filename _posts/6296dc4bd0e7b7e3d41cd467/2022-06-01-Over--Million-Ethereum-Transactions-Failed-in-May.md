## Highlights

- 1,228,131 failed transactions on the network between May 1st and May 31st.
- That’s up 200,000 from last month and over 2% of all failed transactions in its history.
- Transactions on Ethereum are consistently failing at rates of over 1 million per month – despite being paid for.
- High fees have become a long-standing issue for the network, with the cost of gas soaring as high as 474.57 gwei at the start of the month.
- About 1 million transactions failed in April, as with another million in March.
- Five of the failed transactions this month cost over 3 ETH, equal to about $6,000.
