## Highlights

- Logan Paul is one of the biggest influencers in the world, and a one-man brand whose tentacles touch everything from wrestling to podcasts to sugar water.
- He and fellow influencer KSI have recently scored a major mainstream hit with their endorsement of an energy drink called Prime.
- The whole CryptoZoo scam was exposed by investigative journalist CoffeeZilla in January of this year.
- Paul promised $1.8 million of his own money to refunding backers of the game.
- But six months on that's not quite how it seems.
- Paul has moved on to his latest highly profitable ventures, mainly making public appearances to shill Prime, and has just decided to ignore it and pretend it didn't happen.
