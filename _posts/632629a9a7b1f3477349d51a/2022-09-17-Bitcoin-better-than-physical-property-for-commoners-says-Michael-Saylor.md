Geopolitical tensions worldwide determine the type of assets one would be allowed to carry forward across jurisdictions.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) advocate Michael Saylor doubled down on his support for Bitcoin as he spoke at the Australia Crypto Convention.
- Saylor said traditional assets such as gold (in high quantity) and land are nearly impossible to carry forward across geographical boundaries.
- He reiterated that the Bitcoin network has not been hacked for over 13 years and is currently "the most secure network in the world" Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone recently opined that Bitcoin is a ‘wild card’ that is well-positioned to outperform stocks as traditional finance inches toward a recession.
- He said while Bitcoin would follow a similar trend to treasury bonds and gold, Ether “may have a higher correlation with stocks”
