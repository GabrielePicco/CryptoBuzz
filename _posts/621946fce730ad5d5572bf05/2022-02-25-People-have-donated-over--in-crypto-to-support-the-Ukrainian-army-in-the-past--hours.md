Digital assets have “emerged as an important alternative funding method.”

## Highlights

- Ukrainian nongovernmental organization that raises crypto funds for the Ukrainian army has received more than $400,000 worth of digital tokens in the past day.
- The average amount donated is around $1,000 to $2,000, and the group has received at least 317 individual donations in past two days.
- Ukraine is one of the top jurisdictions worldwide for cryptocurrencies, with $8 billion flowing in and out of the country every year, according to an October 2021 report from blockchain data firm Chainalysis.
- Digital assets have “emerged as an important alternative funding method, allowing international donors to bypass financial institutions that are blocking payments to these groups,” Elliptic says.
