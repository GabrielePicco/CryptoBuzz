John Deaton, in a recent ststament, has reaffirmed his confidence on a ripple win. According to Deaton, the SEC's Howey test does not prove XRP to be a security.

## Highlights

- Attorney John E. Deaton, through a recent statement, reaffirmed his conviction that the SEC is not acting in line with the law but rather to strengthen its control over the expanding market.
- Deaton explained the SEC’s reasoning for a summary judgment against Ripple.
- According to him, the defendants do not contest that they offered and sold XRP in return for money,’ which is sufficient evidence to prove the investment of money part of the Howey test.
- The regulator believes that any purchase of XRP immediately satisfies all three prongs of the test since XRP stands for everyday business and investment contracts.
- As a result, XRP is used to denote the collective endeavor in this context.
