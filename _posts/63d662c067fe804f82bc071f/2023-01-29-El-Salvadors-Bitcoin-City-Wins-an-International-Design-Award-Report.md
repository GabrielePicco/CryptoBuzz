## Highlights

- The LOOP Design Awards recognized the Bitcoin City of El Salvador’s government as one of the most outstanding projects in interior design and architecture.
- The Bitcoin City will be built in the southeast of the Latin American country, close to two of the nation’�s biggest volcanoes – Conchagua and Tecapa.
- It will use geothermal energy from the volcanoes to power itself and BTC as its currency.
- The local government planned to raise a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond to finance the construction, which was supposed to mature in 2032.
- The authorities have also started accumulating bitcoin on a macroeconomic level, holding approximately $54 million of it as of now.
