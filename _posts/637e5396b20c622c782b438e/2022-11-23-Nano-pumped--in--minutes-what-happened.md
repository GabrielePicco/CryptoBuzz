The cryptocurrency nano pumped more than 170% on Binance this morning and many are wondering what prompted the price “pump”.

## Highlights

- Nano (XNO) saw a 6,105% increase in volume over the last 24 hours, reaching around $37.87 million being traded in a short span of time.
- Litecoin (LTC) rose more than 25% this morning and Dash (Dash) saw an increase of more than 50% in just a few minutes.
- With a unit price of $10.66, that would mean a 795% move from the current price, at $1.19.19.
- Nano is a lowcap coin, which means that it has a low market capitalization and therefore significant price changes are more common as a smaller amount of capital needs to come in to affect the unit price.
