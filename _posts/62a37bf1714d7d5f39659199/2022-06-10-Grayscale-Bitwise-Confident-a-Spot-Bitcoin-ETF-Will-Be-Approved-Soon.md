Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan pointed to a progression of approval decisions by the SEC that “ends in a spot bitcoin ETF.”

## Highlights

- Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan pointed to a progression of approval decisions by the SEC that “ends in a spot bitcoin ETF” “I think the perception is that day one, a bitcoin ETF launches, and day two it has $30 billion in assets, and that’s just not the way ETF works,” Hougan said.
- “GLD is the fastest-growing ETF of all time.
- It hit $1 billion in three days, then hit $3 billion after a year, and after five years, it hit $30billion.”  Hougan added that GLD hit $2 billion in just three days.
