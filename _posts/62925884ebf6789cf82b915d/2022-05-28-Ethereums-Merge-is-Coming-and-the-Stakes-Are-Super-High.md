The most important upgrade in blockchain history is slated for August. The outcome of the Ethereum merge has huge implications for all of crypto.

## Highlights

- The most important upgrade in blockchain history is slated for August, Roberts says.
- The merge will see the No.
- 2 cryptocurrency switch to a proof-of-stake model.
- Success will bring renewed faith in the future of Web3, while further delays or a botched execution will trigger a price collapse.
- Failure by Ethereum to move beyond the energy-guzzling proof of work system would also provide further ammunition to environmentalists and politicians who already have it in for the crypto industry.
- The outcome of the merge has huge implications for all of crypto.
