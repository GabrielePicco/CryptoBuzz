- The upward movement was preceded by a bullish divergence in the daily RSI (green line) The price has now reclaimed the $30,500 horizontal area, which had been acting as support since May 2021, prior to the May 2022 breakdown.
- In case upward movement continues, the closest resistance levels would be between $37,500 and $40,000 - these are the 0.5-0.618 Fib retracement resistance levels.
- The longer-term wave count also suggests that the price might have bottomed.
