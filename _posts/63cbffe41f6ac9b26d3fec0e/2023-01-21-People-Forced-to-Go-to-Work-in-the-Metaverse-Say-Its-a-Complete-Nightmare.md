According to the people actually already working — or attempting to work — in the Meta's Horizon Worlds metaverse, there are a lot of issues.

## Highlights

- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has put a lot of effort into marketing his expensive metaverse as the future of work.
- According to the people actually already working — or attempting to work — in the Meta's Horizon Worlds mostly-unrealized metaverse, the Zuckerverse doesn't exactly offer that "feeling of presence" quite yet.
- "There's just a lot that can go wrong," an employee at the tech-consulting firm Accenture, a major Meta funder that's attempting to implement Oculus into the workspace, griped to Slate.
- Even just figuring out basic social cues and conventions is apparently pretty difficult, and most of Slate's sources seemed to agree that any merits of current VR work fail to outweigh the many reported downsides.
