Data shows GPU prices have continued to go down recently as Ethereum mining profits have been observing a decline.

## Highlights

- Data shows GPU prices have continued to go down recently as ETH mining profits have been observing a decline.
- The price of the crypto has crashed down over the last few months.
- Miners in zones with high power costs may be left with no choice other than to sell off their cards.
- The impending transition to the proof-of-stake consensus system would obfuscate miners on the network.
- This means that mining has a deadline for ETH mining, sooner than which miners have to turn an ROI to not lose their money.
- It may not be able to make any profit before PoS arrives.
