A new national survey found that inflation hasn't affected US investors' wealth-building strategies. Despite generational inflation, nearly 80% of investors haven't diversified their holdings to hedge against a diminishing dollar.

## Highlights

- 79.1% of US individual investors “haven't taken any action yet” to reduce the effects of inflation in their investment portfolio or retirement accounts.
- Most Americans, while being concerned about inflation, seem more willing to ‘ride it out” than to take action to curb its effects.
- The most popular asset for inflation protection is gold (6%) and precious metals more broadly (9.4%) The next most popular is real estate (5.2%), with only 1.4% of Americans having diversified with Treasuries (i.e., TIPS), an asset created to hedge against inflation-incurred losses.
