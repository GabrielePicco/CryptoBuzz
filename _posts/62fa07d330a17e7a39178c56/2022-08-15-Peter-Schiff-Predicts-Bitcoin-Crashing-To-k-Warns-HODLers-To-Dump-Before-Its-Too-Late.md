Staunch Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has called on crypto hodlers to dump their BTC holdings before it’s too late.

## Highlights

- Peter Schiff has called on crypto hodlers to dump their BTC holdings before it’s too late.
- He predicted Bitcoin going below $10,000 or worse, stating that it would never recapture its all-time high.
- Schiff described bitcoin fanatics as “living in their own bubble” and a “state of delusion’.
- He further claimed that Bitcoin has margin calls yet to be made.
- Once they are made, investors will be prompted to sell, pushing prices lower, leaving devoted investors holding their bags and institutions that got fooled into buying Bitcoin in the bubble, he said.
- Despite Schiff's warning, he is not having a good time with the banks either.
