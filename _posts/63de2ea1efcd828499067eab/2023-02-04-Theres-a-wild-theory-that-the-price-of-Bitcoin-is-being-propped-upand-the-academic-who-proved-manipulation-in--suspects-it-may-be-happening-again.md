Bitcoin's sudden stability is “very suspicious” says John Griffin, finance professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business. “The same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal Bitcoin market.”

## Highlights

- John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, says the price of Bitcoin is being propped up.
- Griffin and his coauthor sifted through 200 gigabytes of trading data, equal to the troves that the Smithsonian Institution collects in two years.
- Griffin: "The same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal Bitcoin market" No definitive proof of chicanery has so far emerged, but it's important to note that no definitive proof so far has emerged that the players are gathering to coordinate buying of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, he says.
- The move is troubling, though Griffin's possible evidence of cozy clubby practices will come to light in the numerous lawsuits and criminal investigations.
