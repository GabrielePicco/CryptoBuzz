Ethereum edges closer to a PoS transition following a successful test of The Merge on Ropsten and two more simulations on key public testnets.

## Highlights

- The Merge on the Ropsten testnet on Wednesday was largely successful as the pace picks up for the switch to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.
- A few bugs remain with client pairs and validating block proposals, but ETH developers assured that fixes are on the way.
- Goerli And Sepolia Testnets are the next stages before The Merge ships to the mainnet later this year.
- ETH’s price remains under $2,000 despite the upcoming switch to PoS consensus mechanism, despite the progress made towards actualizing a watershed moment in the history of the Ethereum network.
