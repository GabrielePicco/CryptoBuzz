It's not all doom and gloom.

## Highlights

- In the first half of the year, venture capitalists bet $17.5 billion on digital currency and blockchain startups.
- That puts investment on course to top the record $26.9 billion raised last year.
- Data suggests a solid faith in the future of crypto and blockchain tech, despite a bruising six months for the industry.
- A double whammy of macroeconomic headwinds and blow-ups at major projects this year have seen bitcoin plummet about 65% from its November record of $69,000.
- Some VCs are shrugging off the gloom, with many deploying substantial war chests as their faith in underlying tech behind crypto coins remains strong.
