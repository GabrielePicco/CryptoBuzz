Sony has filed a major patent for NFTs in games and systems which covers the transfer, trade, and sale of digital items.

## Highlights

- Sony has filed a patent for NFTs in games and systems which covers the transfer, trade, and sale of digital items.
- The patent suggests the technology could be used to provide specific benefits to select players.
- It also suggests a certain level, score, and/or points accumulation in a particular video game could be minted, with this progress then able to be transferred or sold, allowing players to advance their own gameplay via NFT.
- At this stage, it’s unclear how this will be implemented in a meaningful way.
- The bubble of enthusiasm for this technology has already burst, and the benefits outlined here aren’t tantalising enough to make a case for the potential loss of goodwill.
