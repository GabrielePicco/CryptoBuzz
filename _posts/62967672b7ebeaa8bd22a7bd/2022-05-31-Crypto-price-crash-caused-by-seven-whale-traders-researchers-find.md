A cryptocurrency crash that wiped $40 billion from investors’ holdings was caused by just seven traders, according to new research.Crypto analytics firm Nansen

## Highlights

- A cryptocurrency crash that wiped $40 billion from investors’ holdings was caused by just seven traders, according to new research.
- Analytics firm Nansen released an in-depth report on the downfall of Terra’s LUNA and UST tokens earlier this month.
- So-called “whales’ appeared to lose faith in UST's ability to remain pegged to the dollar, causing aggressive selling of the token on crypto exchanges.
- The crash contributed to a market-wide downturn, which saw bitcoin, ETH and other leading cryptocurrencies to fall to 18-month price lows.
- Terra has since launched a new version of LUNA, named Terra 2.0, which it hopes can go some way to compensate investors by airdropping them free tokens.
