It's been reported that the Switzerland-based Bitcoin Association has asked exchanges and miners to block the miner in question.

## Highlights

- The Bitcoin Bitcoin community has taken over 80% control of the network.
- The community has been trying to keep control of it for the past few weeks.
- It has been in the form of a dispute with the community over whether it is the real Bitcoin.
- The majority of the community is behind the creation of the Bitcoin community.
- The dispute is between the community and the creator of the virtual currency, but not the creator, but the community want to keep it under control of what they have called it a ‘fork’ The community is trying to make sure that it is not the same thing as the original version of the original Bitcoin network, which was created in 2008.
