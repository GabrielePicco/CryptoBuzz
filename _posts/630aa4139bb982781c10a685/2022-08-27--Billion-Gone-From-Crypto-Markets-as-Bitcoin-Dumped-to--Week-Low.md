The cryptocurrency market cap has plunged below $1 trillion following the latest price slumps.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin dived below $20,000 for the first time since the middle of July.
- Most altcoins are down to $1,500, while SOL, ADA, and AVAX have declined by up to 8% in a day.
- Overall crypto market cap has seen more than $80 billion evaporate in a single day and is down below $1 trillion for first time in almost a month.
- Bitcoin has bounced off and trades just over that coveted line, but its market cap is below $400 billion.
- ETH was among the best performers until recently, perhaps fueled by the hype about the upcoming Merge Coin.
- Binance Coin, Ripple, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Polygon are also in the red
