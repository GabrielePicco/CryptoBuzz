Exactly a year ago, Nigeria’s central bank prohibited crypto transactions in its financial ecosystem. Even though the central bank has been fighting fiercely against crypto transactions, crypto transactions are still on the rise in Africa's biggest crypto market.

## Highlights

- Exactly a year ago, Nigeria’s central bank prohibited crypto transactions in its financial ecosystem.
- However, the central bank has been fighting fiercely against crypto transactions.
- Peer-to-peer trading of Bitcoins takes a decentralized approach, an increasing number of Nigerians still use their banks to settle in cash while engaging in this form of trading.
- The only legal option is P2P trading as the most popular crypto in the world is available on Africa's largest crypto market.
- Young Nigerians are particularly affected as payment partners transacting in the local currency are no longer willing to deal with crypto exchanges.
- The Central Bank of Nigeria announced the launch of its own digital currency – the electronic naira – the eNaira.
