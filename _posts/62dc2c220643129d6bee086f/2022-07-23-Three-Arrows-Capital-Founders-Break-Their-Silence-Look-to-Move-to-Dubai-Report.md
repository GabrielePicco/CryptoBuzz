The beleaguered duo discussed how one of the most successful crypto funds went from being a prominent trading desk to owing creditors $2.8 billion.

## Highlights

- Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, collapsed last week and owes creditors $2.8 billion.
- Founders Kyle Zhu and Kyle Zhu deny claims they pulled money from the fund before its collapse.
- Pair insists they are cooperating with authorities while trying to keep a low profile.
- Zhu says the reason for the fund's collapse was placing leveraged trades with hope that the crypto market would rebound to the upside.
- Zhu compared 3AC's implosion to that of Celsius Network, a crypto lending firm that froze withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy protection after it failed to keep enough liquidity to honor customer redemptions.
- The founders declined to say where they were, but said their ultimate destination is the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
