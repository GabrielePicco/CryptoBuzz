Virunga's Bitcoin mine is a unique solution to the problem of preserving the park's biodiversity while also generating revenue.

## Highlights

- Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has become the first national park in the world to run a Bitcoin mining mine.
- Sébastien Gouspillou, CEO of Big Block Green Services, introduced Bitcoin mining to the park.
- The park has struggled for revenue in recent years due to violent violence, Ebola outbreaks and kidnappings.
- The mine is powered by one of three hydro plants within the park, a sustainable source of electricity that was already being used to power nearby towns.
- The site has hired nine full-time workers, who work in rotating shifts operating the miners in the jungle.
- Over 200 of the park’s rangers or rangers have been killed since 1996.
