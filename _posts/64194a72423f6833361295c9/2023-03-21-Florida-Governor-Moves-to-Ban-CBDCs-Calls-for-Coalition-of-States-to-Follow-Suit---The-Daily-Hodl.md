Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and is calling on other states to join him.

## Highlights

- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and is calling on other states to join him.
- The Florida Governor and potential 2024 US Presidential candidate says he never wants to see Florida have to use a CBDC as a form of money.
- The legislation should also prohibit any CBDC issued by a foreign reserve or government-sanctioned central bank, he says.
- It will ensure that any effort to adopt a worldwide digital currency never occurs in the free state of Florida.
- The legislation shouldnâ€™t stop there, given a continued increase in Chinese influence on worldwide affairs and the desire to adopt CBDCs worldwide.
