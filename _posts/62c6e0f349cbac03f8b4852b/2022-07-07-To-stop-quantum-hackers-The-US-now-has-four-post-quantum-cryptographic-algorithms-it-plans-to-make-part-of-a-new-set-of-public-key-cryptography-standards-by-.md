The US now has four post-quantum cryptographic algorithms it plans to make part of a new set of public-key cryptography standards by 2024.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected four quantum-resistant algorithms for general encryption and digital signatures.
- The four algorithms will become part of NIST's post-quantum cryptographic standard, expected to be finalized around 2024.
- NIST has currently selected only the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm for the general encryption.
- The algorithm is already used by internet firm Cloudflare in its post-Quantum CIRCL library of cryptographic primitives written in Go.
- The White House in May acknowledged the impending threat of quantum computing and outlined several proposals to accelerate US R&D in quantum computing.
