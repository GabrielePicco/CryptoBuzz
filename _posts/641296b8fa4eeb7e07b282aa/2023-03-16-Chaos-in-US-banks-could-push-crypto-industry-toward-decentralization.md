The crypto industry lost some banking on- and off-ramps due to recent banking turmoil, signaling a potential shift toward decentralization.

## Highlights

- Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank all shut down or were closed last week.
- The shuttering of these banks also has bigger implications on the crypto industry because some were providing services to the industry.
- With these banksâ€™ closure, it will become difficult for cryptocurrency businesses to move money between entities and access banking services, Mina Tadrus, CEO of quant investment management firm Tadrus Capital LLC said.
- This could lead to a decline in participation in participation within the crypto community and make it difficult for crypto startups to build new products or remain operational in the long term, Tadrus said.
- The closure of banks signals a potential shift in the space toward decentralization and a need for regulation.
