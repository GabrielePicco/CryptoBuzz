More than $68 million in crypto donations to Ukraine includes the CryptoPunk #5364 non-fungible token, as the country’s digital ministry finds its feet during the Russian invasion.

## Highlights

- Most of the ministry’s team is under 35-years-old, and most are working remotely, from inside or outside the country.
- The ministry has no plans to sell its donated CryptoPunk #5364, showing a person in a blue bandanna smoking a cigarette, or others of the hundreds of donated NFTs any time soon.
- It's still up in the air if the edition will be limited, and what the NFT will look like.
- The cryptoPunk last sold a year ago for about 16.2 Ethers, worth over $US43,000 in current prices.
- The ministry is working with two companies that are designing an NFT collection that could be ready in less than two weeks.
