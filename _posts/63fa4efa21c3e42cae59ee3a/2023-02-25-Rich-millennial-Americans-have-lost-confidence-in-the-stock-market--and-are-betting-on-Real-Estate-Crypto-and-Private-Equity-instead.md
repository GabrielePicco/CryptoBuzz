Millennials have given up on stocks. Is it time to follow suit?

## Highlights

- Wealthy millennial Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead for long-term tailwinds.
- According to a survey from Bank of America, individuals aged 21 to 42 with at least $3 million in assets only have 25% of their portfolio invested in stocks.
- The recent market volatility may have something to do with these millennials’ decisions, says an expert at UBS.
- Real estate has been a popular asset class as of late — perhaps because it’s a well-known hedge against inflation.
- Cryptocurrency has now entered the mainstream, but some wealthy millennials still believe in the asset class.
