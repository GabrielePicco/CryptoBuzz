As insolvency drama rages on, Roger Ver has found himself in legal trouble with another embattled crypto firm.

## Highlights

- Roger Ver has been summoned to repay over $20 million in damages to Genesis after failing to settle certain cryptocurrency options transactions before the payment deadline.
- Failing to answer the summons will require Ver to repay at least $20,869,788, alongside Genesis’s costs, expenses, and attorney's fees.
- In July, the Seychelles-based crypto exchange CoinFlex sued Ver for $84 million for failing to repay his margin debt.
- Ver is a longtime member of the crypto space, and a proponent of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – a Bitcoin hard fork with an increased block size limit to facilitate faster transactions.
