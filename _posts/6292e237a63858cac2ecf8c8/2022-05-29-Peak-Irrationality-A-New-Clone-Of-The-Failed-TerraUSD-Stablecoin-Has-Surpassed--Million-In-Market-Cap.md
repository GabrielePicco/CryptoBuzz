Despite the humility expressed by certain crypto investors following the dramatic $60 billion UST/LUNA collapse, a carbon copy headed up by a controversial figure is rapidly growing.

## Highlights

- Tron's decentralized stablecoin USD (USDD), almost a carbon copy of Terra’s recently crashed TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, has surpassed $550 million in market capitalization within weeks of its launch on May 5.
- The market value of USDD has doubled since the collapse of UST on May 12, which wiped out $40 billion in investor wealth.
- USDD relies on Tron’S native cryptocurrency TRX, currently trading at $0.082, to maintain the peg - just like UST tried to depend on Terra's LUNA coin to absorb its price volatility.
- Terra offered a lending protocol called Anchor that promised 20% returns but it was bound to fail.
