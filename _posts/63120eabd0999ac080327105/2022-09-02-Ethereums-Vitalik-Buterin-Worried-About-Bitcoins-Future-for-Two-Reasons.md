Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he has concerns over Bitcoin's future owing to its fee model and Proof-of-Work mechanism.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin has said that he is "worried" about Bitcoin's future.
- He said Bitcoin's fee model and Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism could leave Bitcoin vulnerable to attack in the long-term future.
- The Bitcoin creator also gave his thoughts on the crypto market's recent bull run.
- He also defended the idea that Bitcoin could become a multi-trillion-dollar system in the future due to its fee-generating model and its consensus mechanism, but said it would be 'politically infeasible' to switch away from the protocol's current structure.
- The comments will likely spark outrage in some corners of the crypto community, but they are likely to spark outrage.
