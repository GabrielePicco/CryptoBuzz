The price of ApeCoin has dropped 40% over the past week. But what lies behind the fall in price of APE? Read on to learn more…

## Highlights

- ApeCoin (APE) is down by 40% in the last seven days after a price drop in non-fungible token (NFT) metaverse land sold as part of the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s metaverse, The Otherside.
- The rush to buy Otherdeeds – the NFTs representing Otherside land parcels – caused transaction fees on.
- Ethereum gas fees reached an average of $474 per transaction on 1 May as Yuga Labs completed a $600m sale of 95,000 metaverse lands for around $6,000 each.
- Meanwhile, on the crypto market, APE (APE), the governance and utility token utilised in the Ape ecosystem, dropped from a high of almost $25 on 30 April to $15.33.
