The list of bankruptcies, shutdowns, and trading operation freezes continues in Q4 2022 as well.

## Highlights

- Freeway is the latest crypto-staking platform to halt withdrawal services citing volatility in foreign exchange and cryptocurrency markets in recent times.
- Freewayâ€™s native token, FWT, crashed by over 77% with a market cap of around $17 million following the nosedive.
- Whistleblower FatMan Terra alleged that Freeway could be potentially operating a Ponzi scheme and predicted an impending collapse within the next few months.
- The bear market has already claimed many projects, including Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Celsius, and Voyager Digital, in the third quarter of this year following the Terra implosion.
- The list of bankruptcies, shutdowns, and trading operation freezes continues in Q4 2022 as well.
