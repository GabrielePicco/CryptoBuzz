The world's most valuable cryptocurrency is on a tear so far in 2023.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin is down 60% from its all-time high from November 2021, but things could be taking a positive turn.
- Bitcoin is already up 70% so far in 2023, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is up 12%.
- A $100,000 price target implies a 270% gain between now and the end of the year.
- In 2020, Bitcoin's price soared by 309% and before that, the crypto's price skyrocketed 1,300% in 2017, the year when blockchain technology had its coming-out party.
- Bitcoin's focus on self-custody and being a bearer asset owned fully by the owner illustrates that a financial tool like this is necessary.
