European Union to limit cash usage and stronger oversight on crypto transactions of over 1,000 euros ($1,055) Countries will be allowed to reduce the limit even more. The European Central Bank (ECB) expressed its disagreement with this

## Highlights

- European Union to put limit of €10,000 ($10,557) on cash payments and to exert stronger oversight on crypto transactions of over 1,000 euros ($1,055) The bloc agreed that crypto transactions moving over €1,000 in value will face due diligence inquiries by the virtual asset service providers (VASPs) facilitating them.
- VASPs will have to introduce risk mitigation elements when dealing with self-hosted wallets, and other specific measures directed to control cross-border payments using cryptocurrency.
- The European Central Bank (ECB) expressed its disagreement with this back in 2018, when the institution qualified the measure as “disproportionate”
