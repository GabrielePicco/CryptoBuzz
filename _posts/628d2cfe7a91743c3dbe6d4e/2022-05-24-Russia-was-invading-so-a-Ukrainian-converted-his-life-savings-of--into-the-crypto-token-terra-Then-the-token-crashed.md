The Kyiv, Ukraine, resident said he wanted to avoid the risks from Russia's war or a currency collapse.

## Highlights

- Ukraine resident wanted to protect his savings from a currency collapse or war.
- He put the $10,500 sum into a stablecoin called terra, which later crashed in value.
- Popovich's account is one of many stories of retail investors being burned by the crypto crash.
- The International Monetary Fund sounded the alarm in March that food and oil prices around the world were increasing because of the war.
- The global cryptocurrency market has lost about $500 billion since terra began to unravel in early May, according to CoinMarketCap data.
- The token's free fall exacerbated fears in the broader cryptocurrency market, which had been reeling from rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions.
