The Portuguese Parliament, rejected not one but two different proposals to tax Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

## Highlights

- The Portuguese Parliament, Assembleia da República, rejected not one but two different proposals to tax Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
- The proposals were put up by the left-leaning parties Bloco de Esquerda and Livre and were both shot down during a voting session for the 2022 budget on May 25.
- The Socialist Party, which is now in power and controls the majority of the parliamentary assembly, has not presented any bills as of yet.
- Despite this, there is a possibility that Portugal may no longer exclude cryptocurrencies from taxation in the near future.
- The country’s Minister of Finance Fernando Medina said that the government would begin taxing cryptocurrencies.
