Algorand Foundation is partnering with Boston University and Hello Tractor to develop an application where local farmers can share access to tractors. The project is the first to combine blockchain technology and contract theory to help firms ‘leapfrog

## Highlights

- Algorand Foundation is partnering with Boston University and Hello Tractor to develop an application where local farmers can share access to tractors.
- The project is the first to combine blockchain technology and contract theory to help firms ‘leapfrog’ institutional and infrastructure problems in Africa and other developing countries and drive the formation of pro-poor, inclusive digital ecosystems.
- The world faces a serious food shortage: we must increase food production by nearly 60% to feed the world’s population by 2050.
- We cannot do so on current technology, as most of the world's farmers rely on hand tools to plow their land,” explains Professor John Greenacre.
