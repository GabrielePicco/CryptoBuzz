The Ethereum Index Fund is the latest of several crypto products from $4.5 trillion asset manager Fidelity.

## Highlights

- Fidelity registered its Fidelity Ethereum Index Fund on Tuesday.
- The asset manager has $4.5 trillion on its books.
- The first sale of the new fund took place on September 26.
- Fidelity has also been busy working on a crypto exchange, EDX Markets, with Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities and other backers.
- The new Fidelity fund enters an increasingly crowded field with other prominent Bitcoin-related funds, Bitwise's and ETHE's.
- The main difference between index funds, like Fidelity’s new offering, and exchange-traded funds, is how they’re traded.
