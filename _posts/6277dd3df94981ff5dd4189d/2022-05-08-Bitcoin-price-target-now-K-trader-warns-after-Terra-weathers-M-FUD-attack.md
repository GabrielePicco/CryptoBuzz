BTC price action not “fueled” by Terra events, says trader as Bitcoin nears $34,000.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC/USD) dipped to $34,200 on Bitstamp on May 8, recovering to trade around $500 higher at the time of writing.
- The pair had seen brief support around the $36,000 mark, but this gave way as thin weekend liquidity added to the volatility.
- Terra, which pledged to buy unlimited amounts of BTC to back its stablecoin TerraUSD, saw its first major test as a market participant mass sold UST worth almost $300 million.
- TerraUSD briefly saw its dollar peg eroded by up to 0.8%.
- On-chain monitoring resource Coinglass countered 24-hour liquidations for both Bitcoin and Ether running at around $80 million.
