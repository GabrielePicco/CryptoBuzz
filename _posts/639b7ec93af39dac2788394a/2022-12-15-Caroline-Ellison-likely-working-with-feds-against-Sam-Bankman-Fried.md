Sam Bankman-Fried's reported ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, was likely among the first people to turn on him and help prosecutors build their fast-moving fraud case.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried’s reported ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, was likely among the first people to turn on him and help prosecutors build their fast-moving fraud case in the epic, $8 billion-plus collapse of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange.
- Ellison, 28, is a key figure in the case as she was at one time CEO of the Alameda Research hedge fund, which authorities claim received billions of dollars from FTX.
- The speed of the indictment means “someone relatively senior is cooperating with the federal authorities in exchange for leniency for their own potential misconduct,” former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer Howard Fischer told The Post.
