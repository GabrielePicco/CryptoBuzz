- The new integration significantly simplifies the process of buying crypto without using credit or debit cards in Nigeria.
- The integration is estimated to reduce the decline rate for direct crypto purchases in Nigeria from 90% to 30%.
- According to the Chainalysis 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index, Nigeria is one of the world's top 20 ranked countries in cryptocurrency adoption.
- Some reports suggest that 35% of the Nigerian population aged 18 to 60 owned or traded cryptocurrencies in 2022.
- That is despite the Central Bank of Nigeria banning banks from servicing crypto exchanges in February 2021.
