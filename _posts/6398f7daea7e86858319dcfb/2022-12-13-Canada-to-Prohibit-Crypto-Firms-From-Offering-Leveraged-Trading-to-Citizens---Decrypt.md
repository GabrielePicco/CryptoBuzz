Following “recent events in the crypto market,” Canada’s securities regulator is clamping down hard on crypto firms.

## Highlights

- Canadian Securities Administrators announced tighter rules on crypto firms in Canada.
- Firms will also have to hold the assets of Canadian clients separately from their proprietary business.
- Canadian authorities have taken a largely skeptical view of cryptocurrencies.
- But local pension funds have been hit by some of the biggest blow-ups in crypto this year, with the Caisse de Dépôt having invested $150 million into collapsed lender Celsius and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan had $95 million in FTX.
- Meanwhile, securities regulators have been cracking down on unregistered firms, calling out major platforms like KuCoin and Binance by name for failing to get authorization for them.
