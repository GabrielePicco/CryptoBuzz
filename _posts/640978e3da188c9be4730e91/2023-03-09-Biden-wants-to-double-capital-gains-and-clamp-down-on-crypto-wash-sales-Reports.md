The Biden administration is set to release its fiscal 2024 budget plan which includes closing a certain crypto tax harvesting loophole.

## Highlights

- The Biden administration is set to release its fiscal 2024 budget plan on Mar.
- 9.
- It is reportedly aimed at reducing the deficit by almost $3 trillion over the next decade.
- It also includes changes to crypto tax treatment with the aim of raising around $24 billion.
- One of these proposals includes an end to a strategy in which a crypto trader sells assets at a loss for tax purposes, known as tax-loss harvesting, before repurchasing them immediately after.
- The Biden budget also proposes to nearly double the capital gains tax rate for investors making at least $1 million to pay 39.6% on long-term investments, up from the current 20% rate.
