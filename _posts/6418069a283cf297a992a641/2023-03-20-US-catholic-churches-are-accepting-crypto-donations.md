Now you can please god with crypto, as US Catholic Churches are accepting donations via digital assets.

## Highlights

- US Catholic Churches are accepting donations via digital assets.
- The Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., has partnered with a new platform called Engiven.
- They will use the funds to grow their ministries and implement new initiatives.
- The Vatican, which is the official resistance of the Pope, hasn’t made any comment on the use of crypto for making donations.
- Many dislike the idea of crypto because it made many people rich who invested in these digital assets early.
- And now they can exchange their so-called “artificial wealth” for real goods, services and lands.
