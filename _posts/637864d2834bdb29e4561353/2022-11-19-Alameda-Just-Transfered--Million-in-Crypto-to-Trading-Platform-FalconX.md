The $17 million transaction was an internal transfer at FalconX, according to a source familiar with the matter.

## Highlights

- $17 million USDC transfer from wallets labeled as belonging to Alameda Research was misattributed to institutional crypto exchange FalconX.
- FTX CEO John J Ray says $372 million worth of funds were moved out of its wallets on the same day FTX filed for bankruptcy.
- Alameda has sent $3.6 million of Game of Gods (GOG), Covalent Query Token (CQT), ETH, Render (REN), and Polygon (MATIC) tokens to a multi-signature WalletSimple account over the past couple days.
- FalconX CEO and co-founder Raghu Yariagadda said FalconX has no exposure to Genesis, which itself said it has $175 million of funds stuck on FTX.
