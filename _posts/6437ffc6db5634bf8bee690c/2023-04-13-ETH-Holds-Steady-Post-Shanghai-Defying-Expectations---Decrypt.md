ETH's price stayed remarkably stable in the minutes following Ethereum's historic, successful Shanghai upgrade.

## Highlights

- ETH's price stayed remarkably stable in the minutes following the successful implementation of the historic, successful Shanghai upgrade.
- The upgrade enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH by the network's participants.
- Analysts expected more than $300 million worth of ETH to be liquidated immediately following Shanghai's launch.
- But neither that factor, nor Shanghai's position as a notable, tradable moment in Ethereum's history, appear to have impacted the price of ETH whatsoever, at least not yet.
- In the five days leading up to the merge event, ETH climbed up 3% in the days prior to their execution, but only 3% of that time it climbed up.
