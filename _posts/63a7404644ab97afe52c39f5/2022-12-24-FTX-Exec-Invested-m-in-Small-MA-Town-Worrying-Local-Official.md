Local newspaper The Berkshire Eagle reported last year that Ryan Salame owns almost half the restaurants in Lenox, MA.

## Highlights

- Ryan Salame, a co-CEO at FTX Digital Markets, reportedly bought $6 million of restaurants and real estate in Lenox, Massachusetts.
- The town is "concerned" about what FTX's collapse "means for Lenox," a local official told The Berkshire Eagle.
- FTX has since filed for bankruptcy and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was arrested last week.
- The Wall Street Journal reported that Salame vomited upon hearing that FTX was about to collapse, and Salame alerted authorities about potential wrongdoing at the company, according to court filings.
- Salame received a $55 million loan from FTX and donated $23 million to mostly Republican political candidates.
