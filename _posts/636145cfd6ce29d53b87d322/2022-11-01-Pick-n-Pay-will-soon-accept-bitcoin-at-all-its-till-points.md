Pick n Pay will soon allow its consumers to pay for groceries with crypto at 39 stores, and at all stores nationwide within months.

## Highlights

- Pick n Pay has been experimenting with cryptocurrency payments for several years.
- It plans to roll out the crypto service to all of its stores in the “coming months’s” It follows the conclusion of a first phase of a new pilot by the retailer that allows customers to pay using cryptocurrency on their smartphones using a “trusted app” Customers scan a QR code from the app and accept the rand conversion rate on their smartphone at the time of the transaction.
- The service fee for each transaction is minimal, costing the customer on average 70c, and takes less than 30 seconds.
- The retailer said it ran the pilot in 10 Western Cape stores over the past five months.
