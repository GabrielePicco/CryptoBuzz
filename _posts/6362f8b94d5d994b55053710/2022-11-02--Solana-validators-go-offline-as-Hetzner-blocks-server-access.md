## Highlights

- Cloud provider was already contemplating a ban on crypto node operators, according to a previous report by The Block.
- The Solana status page is not showing any outages, as of the time of reporting.
- The network seems to be unaffected despite having 22% of the Solana stake of the security vote offline.
- The company's terms of service state that crypto activity is prohibited by the terms of its terms and does not respond to a request for comment.
