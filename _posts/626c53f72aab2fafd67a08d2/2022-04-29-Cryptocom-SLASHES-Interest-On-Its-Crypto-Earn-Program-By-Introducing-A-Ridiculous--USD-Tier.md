You're officially a whale now if you have more than 3,000 USD in crypto.

## Highlights

- Crypto.com (CDC) announced today that it will be revising its Crypto Earn rates by introducing a new tier into the program.
- This is not the first time CDC does this, but the new tier, however, is far more aggressive.
- Any user with more than 3,000 USD in Crypto Earn will make only 0.5x of the base interest rate.
- CDC most recently did this only one month ago (on the 26th of March) when it introduced a. new tier for those with more.
- than 30,000.
- USD locked will earn no more than 0.3x of tier two (with the.5x multiplier = so 0.15x)
