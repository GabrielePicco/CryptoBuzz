Ukraine has passed its Law On Virtual Assets recognizing crypto as a legal asset and will include an official regulator to oversee activity

## Highlights

- Ukraine's parliament has passed amendments to its law “On Virtual Assets,” ratifying the eventual creation of a legal market for cryptocurrencies.
- The bill will see the National Commission on Securities and Stock Market installed as the primary regulator for crypto.
- The commission will be responsible for shaping policy, determining the order for the circulation of crypto, issuing licenses to virtual asset service providers and watchdog responsibilities.
- The country is also working on changes to its tax and civil codes with the minister’s office, as part of the move to embrace domestic crypto adoption.
- The move comes as Russia has maintained a large military presence in the region, capable of an invasion, according to US President Joe Biden.
