SBF is still a free man while FTX users want to know where the billions went.

## Highlights

- The Bahamas Attorney General L. Ryan Pinder released a video statement on Sunday night about the investigation into crypto platform FTX.
- FTX filed for bankruptcy over two weeks ago in Delaware court, taking billions of dollars with it.
- Pinder insisted that the Bahamas is a place of laws and the rule of law is strong.
- The Bahamas is infamous as a tax haven for the ultra-wealthy from around the world and has been actively courting crypto companies in recent years to set up shop in the former British colony.
- But FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried reportedly was using customer deposits from FTX to make risky investments via his hedge fund Alameda Research.
