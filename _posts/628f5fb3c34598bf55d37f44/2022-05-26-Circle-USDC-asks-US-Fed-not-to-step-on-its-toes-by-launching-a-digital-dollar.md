Binance cryptocurrency exchange - We operate the worlds biggest bitcoin exchange and altcoin crypto exchange in the world by volume

## Highlights

- Circle Internet Financial argues that a central bank digital currency could have a chilling effect on new innovations.
- The company's stablecoin, USDC, is backed by “cash and short-duration U.S.
- government obligations” and assures the public regularly with attestations about the content of those reserves.
- Circle also underlined potential harms a digital dollar might pose to traditional banking, which the banking industry itself pointed out in its own letters.
- The stablecoin industry has been suffering collateral damage recently from the ugly collapse of TerraUSD (UST), though that was an algorithmic stablecoin not one backed by reserves.
- The Fed has said it doesn’t intend to move forward on a CBDC without backing from the White House and Congress.
