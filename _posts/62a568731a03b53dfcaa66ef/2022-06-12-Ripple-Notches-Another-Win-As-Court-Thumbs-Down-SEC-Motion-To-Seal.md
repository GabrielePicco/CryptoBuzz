As the Ripple community braces for the major ruling on the key judgement on the Hinman 2018 documents, Ripple Labs has scored another victory as presiding

## Highlights

- The price of XRP, Ripple’s native coin, increased somewhat following the announcement.
- Ripple Labs and the SEC have been embroiled in a legal spat for quite a while, with new filings occurring every day.
- The SEC moved to seal its opposition to an amici request to participate in Patrick Doody's expert challenge, it cited safety as a rationale.
- However, Ripple and its allies promptly rebutted the SEC's arguments.
- Four of the five reasons cited by the SEC in its request letter “do not constitute a risk to human life,” according to Ripple.
- The court also demands the regulatory agency to submit a statement by June 14 justifying its proposed redactions and identifying which exhibits it wishes to seal.
