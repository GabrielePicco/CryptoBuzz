Kraken, a leading crypto exchange, has secured crucial regulatory approval in Ireland ahead of the landmark EU vote on crypto.

## Highlights

- Kraken receives key regulatory approval from the Bank of Ireland ahead of EU vote on crypto.
- European Parliament is set to vote on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.
- The law will likely pass with widespread support, since lawmakers from multiple parties have already signaled their support for the law.
- The regulation would allow crypto exchanges and digital wallet companies to offer regulated services.
- It would also require stablecoin issuers to hold significant reserves.
- The EU has signaled its opposition to crypto mining.
