Cyble Intelligence and Research Lab (CRIL) discovered several phishing campaigns that use MSI Afterburner to deliver XMR (Monero) cryptomining and information-stealing malware via 50+ fake replica websites.

## Highlights

- Websites have been impersonating MSI Afterburner's official site to trick users into downloading malware alongside the free gaming tool.
- Cyble Intelligence and Research Lab (CRIL) discovered several phishing campaigns that use the tool to deliver XMR (Monero) cryptomining and information-stealing malware via 50+ fake replica websites.
- The RedLine Stealer is running in the background, pilfering passwords, cookies, browser information, and (potentially) cryptocurrency wallets.
- The malicious elements are only detected by a tiny number of antivirus programs so discovering you've been infected might not be as easy as running a security tool.
