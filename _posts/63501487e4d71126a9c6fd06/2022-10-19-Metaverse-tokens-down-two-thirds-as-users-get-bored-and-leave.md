The metaverse bubble burst in 2022. Virtual land trading volumes have declined 98% and tokens have lost two-thirds of their value YTD.

## Highlights

- Metaverse tokens burst onto the world stage on a tidal wave of enormous promises and mind-boggling figures.
- Speculators enjoyed big returns on rapidly appreciating plots of land in Decentraland, The Sandbox, Earth2, or NFT Worlds.
- Users simply don’t stick around with very little to do outside of events organized by developers.
- Virtual land trading volumes have declined 98% and tokens have lost two-thirds of their value this year.
- The Wall Street Journal has interviewed a number of Meta employees who have branded their own project unusable.
- It estimates that metaverse registrations are 300,000 people shy of the company’s 2022 goal.
