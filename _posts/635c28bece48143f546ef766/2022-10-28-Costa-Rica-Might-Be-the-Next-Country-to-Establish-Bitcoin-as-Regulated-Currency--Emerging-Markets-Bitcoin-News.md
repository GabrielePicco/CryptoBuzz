Costa Rica could be one of the next countries to adopt bitcoin as a regulated payment method, as a bill to include the asset was introduced.

## Highlights

- Congresswoman Johana Obando introduced a bill to allow bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to serve as a form of payment in Costa Rica.
- The bill also proposes that traditional banking institutions be able to service as crypto exchanges, including custody and wallet services for their customers.
- This is different from what countries like El Salvador have done, that have adopted bitcoin as legal tender.
- This might be directed to increase the level of financial inclusion in the country, with almost 82% of citizens older than 18 years having access to a bank account, if the bill is approved and sanctioned, these levels could ostensibly increase.
- This bill wants to propose Costa Rica as an investment center for crypto-related people and companies.
