FTX Japan is developing systems to enable customers to recover their stuck assets via local crypto exchange Liquid Japan.

## Highlights

- Japanese subsidiary of now-bankrupt FTX looking to begin returning customer assets from February next year.
- FTX Japan said it is developing systems to enable its customers to withdraw their assets via Liquid Japan, a crypto trading platform acquired by FTX Trading Ltd in an undisclosed deal this spring.
- The three-step process will see customers open Liquid Japan accounts by mid-January, followed by balance checks and the opening of withdrawals in mid-February.
- The Japanese company said it confirmed earlier this month it was holding about $94.5 million in crypto assets and $46 million in fiat currency in designated client accounts.
- The company was less than six months old when its parent company collapsed.
