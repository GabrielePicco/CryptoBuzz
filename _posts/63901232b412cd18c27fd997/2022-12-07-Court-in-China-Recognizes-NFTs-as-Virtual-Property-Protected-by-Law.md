A court in the Chinese city of Hangzhou has determined that non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent virtual property protected by the law.

## Highlights

- Court in China recognizes non-fungible tokens as virtual property protected by law.
- Ruling comes from a case over a dispute between a customer and a platform hired to sell a collection of tokens.
- The platform, which issued a refund, explained that its move had to do with the inaccurate personal information it received from the plaintiff.
- Last year, the Chinese government launched a nationwide crackdown on crypto-related activities like the issuance, trading, and mining of digital coins such as bitcoin.
- To avoid associations with the crypto space, NFTs are often called “digital collectibles” rather than “non-frugible tokens”
