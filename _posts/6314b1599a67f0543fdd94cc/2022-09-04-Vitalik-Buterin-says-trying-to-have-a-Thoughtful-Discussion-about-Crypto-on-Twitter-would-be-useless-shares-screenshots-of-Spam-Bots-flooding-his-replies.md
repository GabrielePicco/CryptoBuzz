I'm afraid you have reached a notoriety that prevents you from engaging in the same debates/thoughts you were used to. Gotta process the fact that you're a \"star\" now, however repulsive that idea might be.

## Highlights

- You have reached a notoriety that prevents you from engaging in the same debates/thoughts you were used to.
- Gotta process the fact that you're a "star" now, however repulsive that idea might be.
- I'm afraid to process that you are now a'star' Now, however, I'm sorry to say goodbye to the idea of being a "Star" Now, I don't think you'll be able to engage in the debates you're used to, but you'll look forward to the possibility of being the star of your own life again.
- Don't forget that that idea may be a problem for you now.
