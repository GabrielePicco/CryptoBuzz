Do Kwon and Terraform Labs told to comply with SEC probes over possible unregistered securities.

## Highlights

- The US Federal Court of Appeal has ordered Do Kwon and Terraform Labs to comply with subpoenas served by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
- The SEC launched investigations into Terra’s Mirror Protocol back in 2021 over unregistered securities claims.
- The probe was meant to determine if the company's Mirror Protocol violated federal securities laws.
- The investigation is not related to the crumble of Terra's original tokens – LUNA and UST - LUNA – but the probe is not connected to the collapse of UST and LUNC (formerly LUNA) The first ruling issued on February 17, 2022, requested that both parties comply with the subpoenas.
- The initial ruling was affirmed by a panel of three judges on Wednesday.
