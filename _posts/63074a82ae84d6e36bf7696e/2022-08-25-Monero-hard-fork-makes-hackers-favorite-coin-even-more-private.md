Monero, the privacy-oriented decentralized cryptocurrency project, underwent a planned hard fork event on Saturday, introducing new features to boost its privacy and security.

## Highlights

- Monero, the privacy-oriented decentralized cryptocurrency project, underwent a planned hard fork event on Saturday, introducing new features to boost its privacy and security.
- The hard fork now features a larger ring size (from 11 to 16), an improved 'Bulletproofs' algorithm for faster transactions, a revamped multisig mechanism, and performance upgrades that reduce wallet sync times by 30-40%.
- The upgrade is a hard fork sitting on 0.18 'Fluorine Fermi', so the new version isn't backward compatible with older ones.
- Monero is considered to have superior privacy over other cryptocurrency projects because of its "ring signature" transaction obfuscation mechanism.
