The crypto trader behind the $110 million exploit of the Solana (SOL)-based decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platform Mango Markets is now under the custody of US authorities.

## Highlights

- Avraham Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico on Monday, December 26th.
- Eisenberg admitted in October that he is the brain behind the scheme that left Mango Markets insolvent and users unable to access their funds.
- The arrest comes after Eisenberg is charged with commodities fraud and manipulation.
- The self-described digital art dealer was able to borrow and withdraw large amounts of crypto assets from the platform.
- He is aware of laws prohibiting market manipulation and even attempted to evade arrest when he flew from the US to Israel a day after committing the scheme.
- The Daily Hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets, nor is an investment advisor.
