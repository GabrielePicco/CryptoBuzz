One year after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) barred financial institutions from handling cryptocurrency-related transactions, the number of youths getting involved in speculative trading...

## Highlights

- Nigerian youths are getting involved in speculative trading, a part of the fast-growing online gaming and gambling culture.
- The novel cryptocurrency blurs the line between gambling, speculation and investment.
- The majority rarely know what they are betting their money on, but are merely influenced by unrealistic fantasies and pressure from equally amateurish ‘investors’ Many Nigerians trading such assets avoid terms that may give them away to the settlement banks to avoid the ban, while others deploy digital wallets and other forms of peer-to-peer platforms of functions.
- Housewives, professionals and artisans have joined the game, which used to be exclusive to students and digitally savvy individuals.
