CEO Jesse Powell unveiled Kraken's \"Jet Ski Program,\" which incentivizes exits from people who aren't down for the cause, the New York Times reported.

## Highlights

- Kraken CEO offers four months' worth of pay for employees who don't agree with his values.
- Employees have until June 20 to take part in the program, dubbed "Jet Ski," to leave.
- The New York Times report cites "hurtful" comments about preferred pronouns and demeaning women.
- The publication cites a 31-page document, called "Kraken Culture Explained," as a "recommitment" to the company's core values.
- It's common in cryptocurrency and other decentralized finance spaces, with some conservative figures decrying "woke" ideals in favor of what they view as free speech, like Chappelle's comments about transgender people.
