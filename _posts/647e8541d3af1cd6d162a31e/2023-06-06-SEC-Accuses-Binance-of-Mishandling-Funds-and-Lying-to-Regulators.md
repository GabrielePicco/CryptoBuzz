The S.E.C. said the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange mixed billions of dollars in customer funds and secretly sent them to a separate company controlled by Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao.

## Highlights

- The S.E.C.
- said Binance mixed billions of dollars in customer funds and secretly sent them to a separate company controlled by Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao.
- Regulators have long seen the exchange as a major target in their quest to bring to heel a crypto industry that has been built around an explicitly anti-government ethos.
- U.S.-based customers were supposed to have access only to an ostensibly separate company formed specifically to operate within the United States, called BinanceUS.US.
- The complaint also said the exchange had misled investors about the adequacy of its systems to detect and control manipulative trading.
