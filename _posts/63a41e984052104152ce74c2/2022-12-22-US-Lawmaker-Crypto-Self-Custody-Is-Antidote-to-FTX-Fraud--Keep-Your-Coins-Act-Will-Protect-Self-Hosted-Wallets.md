U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson is pushing for his “Keep Your Coins Act,\" noting that self-custody of crypto is the antidote to FTX's fraud.

## Highlights

- Congressman Warren Davidson has touted self-custody of cryptocurrencies as the antidote to FTX’s fraud.
- He is pushing for his bill called “Keep Your Coins Act,” which aims to “protect self-Custody from misguided attempts to restrict it” Senator Elizabeth Warren and numerous other members of Congress have proposed bans on crypto.
- Davidson said he believes former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested before the House and Senate hearings took place because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators “did not want to give Congress an opportunity to ask SBF about their failed oversight”
