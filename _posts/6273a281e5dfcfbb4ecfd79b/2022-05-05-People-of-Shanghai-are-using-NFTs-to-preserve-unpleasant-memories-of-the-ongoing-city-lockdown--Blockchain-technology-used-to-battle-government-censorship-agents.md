Inhabitants of Shanghai, China's most populous city, have been employing the use of blockchain technology to protect the memories of the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown in their state.

## Highlights

- Chinese censorship agents have been reportedly pulling down these posts, referring to them as “rumors”
