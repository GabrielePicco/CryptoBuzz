Genesis, the crypto lender owned by DCG, filed for bankruptcy protection, the latest collapse to follow FTX's implosion in November.

## Highlights

- Crypt-lending company Genesis files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
- The company listed over 100,000 creditors with aggregate liabilities ranging from $1.2 billion to $11 billion.
- The bankruptcy puts Genesis alongside other fallen crypto exchanges including BlockFi, FTX, Celsius, and Voyager.
- Source: Genesis is in negotiations with creditors represented by law firms Kirkland & Ellis and Proskauer Rose, sources familiar with the matter tell CNBC.
- The filing follows months of speculation over whether Genesis would enter bankruptcy protection, and just days after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Genesis and its onetime partner, Gemini, over unregistered offering and sale of securities.
