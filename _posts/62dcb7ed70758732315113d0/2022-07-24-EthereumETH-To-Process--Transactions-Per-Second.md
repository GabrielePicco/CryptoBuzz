Vitalik Buterin, the Etherium co-founder mentions that Ethereum(ETH) network will be able to potentially process 100k transactions per second, Read CNL.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin has stated that the ETH network will be able to carry out 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) after it implements all the necessary changes.
- The main aim of this upgrade is to help the network become more scalable so that it can be used by a larger number of people.
- This upgrade stage will have numerous benefits for the network users as it would allow for a much higher TPS rate.
- This would put the network on par with some of the major credit card companies in terms of transaction processing.
- The altcoin Ethereum(ETH) is burning 1,559 ETH daily as it heads to its other big goal-staking ETH.
