Sushi is a DEX, we're a one-stop shop for all your decentralized finance needs.

## Highlights

- $MOON tokens are an ERC-20 token on Arbitrum Nova launched by Reddit admins in May 2020 as a part of the Community Points project.
- Moons are independent of Reddit and once earned neither the admins nor the subreddit moderators can take them away from users.
- Sushi is a decentralized exchange, we aim to be a one-stop shop for all your decentralized finance (DeFi) needs.
- We use a collection of liquidity pools to achieve this goal.
- Users first lock up assets into smart contracts, and traders then buy and sell cryptocurrencies from those pools, swapping out one token for another.
- Buy r/CryptoCurrency Special Membership with $MOONS to enable your Membership!
