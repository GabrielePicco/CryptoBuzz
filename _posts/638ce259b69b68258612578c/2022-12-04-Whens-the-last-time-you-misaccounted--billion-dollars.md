Good Old SBF is at it again. I want to start covering other stories, but the FTX collapse keeps on generating headline after headline, so I might as well continue. SBF had a recent interview with…

## Highlights

- Former CEO of a multi-billion dollar crypto company, Good Old SBF, had a recent interview with Bloomberg.
- The interview paints a detailed picture of SBF’s demeanour as well as his character and of course, his environment.
- SBF seems to be married to the idea that it was his sloppiness all along that caused the FTX collapse.
- The way he seems to see himself in his head, at least until the collapse, is as a real life rags-to-riches superhero.
- Even if this chaotic-good alignment were true, this is the mindset of a selfish, delusional megalomaniac.
