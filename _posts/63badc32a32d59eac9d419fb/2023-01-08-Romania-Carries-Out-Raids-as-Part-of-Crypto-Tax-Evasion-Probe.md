Authorities in Romania have conducted more than a dozen raids against people suspected of hiding income from cryptocurrency operations.

## Highlights

- Authorities in Romania have conducted more than a dozen raids against people suspected of hiding income from cryptocurrency operations.
- The raids took place in late 2022 following an earlier investigation which established that crypto traders had failed to report digital assets exceeding $50 million in value.
- Investigators allege that, between 2019 and 2022, 19 targeted individuals formed or joined an organized crime group for the purpose of tax evasion.
- According to preliminary estimates, their activities have resulted in losses for the state budget totalling 3 million Romanian lei (almost $650,000) The operation was conducted after the tax fraud combatting unit of the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF) launched a probe last summer.
