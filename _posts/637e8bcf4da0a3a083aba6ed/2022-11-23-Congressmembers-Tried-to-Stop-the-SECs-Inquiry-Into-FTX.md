The ‘Blockchain Eight’ wrote a bipartisan letter in March attempting to chill the SEC’s information requests to crypto firms. FTX was one of those firms.

## Highlights

- The Prospect has confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission sought information from collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
- Eight members of the ‘Blockchain Eight’ questioned the SEC’s authority to make informal inquiries to crypto and blockchain companies.
- Five of the eight members received campaign donations from FTX employees, ranging from $2,900 to $11,600.
- FTX was one of those firms receiving information requests from the SEC, about the very activities that have brought down the firm.
- Some of the members who received donations from the firm received $2.75 million in the 2022 cycle; another received half a million dollars in support from the FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame.
