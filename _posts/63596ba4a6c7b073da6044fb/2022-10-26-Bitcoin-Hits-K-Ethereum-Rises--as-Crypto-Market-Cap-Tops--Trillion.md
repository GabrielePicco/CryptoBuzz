Ethereum reaches levels unseen since soon after the merge as the wider crypto market takes a break from the doldrums.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin is back above $20,000 for the first time in weeks and ETH hits $1,500 for first time since September 15.
- Overall market is up 6% today, with the total market cap of $1.03 trillion, up from October 4.
- Analysts point to macroeconomic trends, with Wall Street also up today as major companies report earnings.
- The U.S.
- Federal Reserve is also expected to calm its aggressive interest rate hike this week, analyst Edward Moya says, "and that is helping investors grow confident that the Fed will be in a better position to downshift their tightening pace after next week’s FOMC meeting”
