Bitcoin Cross-Platform C++ Development Toolkit. Contribute to libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system development by creating an account on GitHub.

## Highlights

- The value of Bitcoin over alternatives derives directly from removing the state from control over monetary supply and transaction censorship.
- Advantages include freedom from seigniorage, foreign exchange controls, and financial surveillance.
- These allow the money to be transferred to any person, in any place, at any time, without need for third party permission.
- These advantages represent cost reduction through the avoidance of tax.
- It would be an error to assume these advantages flow from the existence of a more efficient technology than employed by monopoly monies.
- The technology is far less efficient, yet it helps people resist state controls.
