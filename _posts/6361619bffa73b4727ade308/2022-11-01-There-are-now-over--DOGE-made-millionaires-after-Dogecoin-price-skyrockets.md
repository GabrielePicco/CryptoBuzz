Last year the meteoric surge in popularity of Dogecoin turned a significant number of retail investors into millionaires.

## Highlights

- Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 16.18% in the last 24 hours, leading the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market gains, up 133.27%.
- The number of DOGE millionaires stood at 1,046 as of November 1, returning above the 1,000 mark for the first time since April 2022.
- Analysts believe that the recent surge in the price of the asset may be ascribed to the tokenâ€™s potential use case on Twitter as a payment system.
- In the midst of heightened purchasing pressure, the asset experienced weekly gains of over 100% at one point.
- However, the crypto community has low confidence in their price estimate for the asset by the end of November.
