Developers of the Juno cryptocurrency meant to send $36 million in tokens to a community-controlled wallet. Human error sent it to an inaccessible address.

## Highlights

- Developers of Juno cryptocurrency meant to send $36 million in tokens to a community-controlled wallet.
- A developer inadvertently copied and pasted the wrong wallet address, leading to $36M in crypto being sent to an inaccessible address.
- Juno runs on a governance model, where token holders can vote on how it would be spent.
- The problem may be easier for Juno's developers to solve, owing to it being a Proof-of-Stake chain.
- "Funds will go to the correct address in one week or something, it's bad but can be solved easily," one of Juno's founding developers said.
- Such "fat finger" errors aren't uncommon, but the solutions aren't simple.
