An apartment in Braga, Portugal was directly sold for bitcoin for the first time in the country, without needing a conversion into euros.

## Highlights

- An apartment in Braga, Portugal was sold for 3 BTC on Thursday in the first-ever real estate sale directly and entirely made in bitcoin.
- The feat was possible thanks to new rules that became effective last month setting the directives as to how owners and real estate agents could sell properties for cryptocurrency directly.
- The sale of real estate for bitcoin has recently gathered popularity across different parts of the world.
- Before the rules, someone buying a house with bitcoin in Portugal had to first convert it to euros at the time of purchase in order to do the transaction and receive the house deed.
- The move represented the latest major push in the UAE to establish itself as a welcoming region for Bitcoin businesses and services.
