Following the gloomy days of the previous month, the crypto community seems to be experiencing a breath of fresh air as assets stage a form

## Highlights

- ETH whale address holdings have risen to 22.26% in the past month, indicating signs of an accumulation.
- This is an encouraging improvement from the 21.2% recorded in late June when the Crypto Winter was at its coldest, with ETH tumbling below the $1000 mark.
- The Merge, which aims to transition the ETH mainnet from a PoW chain to a PoS chain, has remained the most anticipated event in the crypto community.
- This has led to an increased accumulation rate as investors aim to position themselves for an imminent upsurge.
- As of press time, ETH trades at $1,564, having gained by 43% in seven days.
