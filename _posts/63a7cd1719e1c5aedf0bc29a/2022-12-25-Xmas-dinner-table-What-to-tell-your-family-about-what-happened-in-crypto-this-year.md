Christmas dinner could get awkward for crypto advocates who were adamant about their families investing last year — Cointelegraph compiled a small recap of what happened in crypto this year.

## Highlights

- After a lackluster rise of crypto in 2021, came the dramatic fall in 2022.
- The industry was plagued by macroeconomic pressures, scandals and meltdowns that wiped out fortunes virtually overnight.
- Cointelegraph prepared a small recap to help ‘crypto bros and sisters’ explain what really happened to crypto in 2022 when market pundits were expecting the rise to continue throughout the year.
- The collapse of the Terra ecosystem had the greatest impact on lenders, bankrupting Three Arrows Capital and many others.
- The chances of many customers getting back their funds are very slim as lawyers have predicted that it might take years and even decades to get the funds back.
