An increasing number of crypto VCs are reporting that most of their portfolio companies are holding back token launches amid weak markets and regulatory scrutiny.

## Highlights

- A growing number of VCs are reporting that at least half of their portfolio projects are holding back the launch of their tokens.
- They cite price, exchange fees and increasingly aggressive regulation as reasons to delay token launches.
- The retreat came down to a combination of factors, from a worsening macro environment, which zapped market liquidity, to increased regulatory scrutiny.
- Since the crisis, many crypto exchanges have moved into a defensive posture, protecting existing liquidity over listing new tokens, a senior executive says.
- In the third quarter of 2022, Spartanâ€™s DeFi fund had returned just 4.5% year-to-date, according to investor documents.
