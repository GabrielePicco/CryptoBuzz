XRP appears to defy the odds by recording significant gains as the token’s parent company Ripple continues to be embroiled in a legal tussle.

## Highlights

- XRP has rallied 57.75% in a month with a value of $0.52 by press time.
- The token has rallied since September 8 after trading on September 8.
- XRP’s positive gains can partly be attributed to the recent developments in the Ripple case with the SEC.
- The SEC is suing Ripple for releasing XRP as a security, but its defense has appeared to falter, translating to the shifting dynamics in XRPs’ price.
- Ripple Labs has been aggressively expanding its services, which saw the company earn a ranking in the top Fintech 250 list.
- If the case is ruled in Ripple's favour, it will be a significant win for XRP.
