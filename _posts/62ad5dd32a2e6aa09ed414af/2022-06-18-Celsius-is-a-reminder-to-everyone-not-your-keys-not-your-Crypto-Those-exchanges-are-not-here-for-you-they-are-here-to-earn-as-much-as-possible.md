## Highlights

- Celsius, one of the biggest lenders in crypto, froze withdrawals amid rumors of insolvency.
- Celsius is different from a centralized exchange (CEX) to a central exchange.
- CEXs, on the other hand, are used for trading, buying NFTs, and other crypto activities.
- Celsius customers deposit their crypto and receive a percentage yield (sometimes in the double digits) which Celsius pays for by selling their (now beleaguered) CEL token, offering loans, and leveraging their treasury.
- It seems many people are taking their funds into cold storage as Bitcoin balances have been in steep decline across the Bitcoin market following the recent TerraUSD (USTUST)
