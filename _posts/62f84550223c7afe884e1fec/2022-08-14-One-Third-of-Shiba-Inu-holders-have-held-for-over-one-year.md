Over 400,000 Shiba Inu holders have held their SHIB for longer than a year, according to Certik.

## Highlights

- The number of long-term Shiba Inu holders has passed the one-third mark.
- 34% of wallets have held SHIB for over a year, with 1.28 million holders.
- The average wallet age among SHIB holders is around nine months, according to Certik.
- ShibaSwap auditor Certik says 400,000 holders have held their SHIB longer than a year.
- According to the auditor, this means they still own at least some SHIB in their wallet.
- This doesnâ€™t mean they have been selling, but it means they have held some of them for a long time.
