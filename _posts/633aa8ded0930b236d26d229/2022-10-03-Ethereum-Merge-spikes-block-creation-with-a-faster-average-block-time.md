The average block time — the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions — for Ethereum dropped by over 13%.

## Highlights

- The Merge upgrade for the Ethereum blockchain has been revealed to have had a positive impact on the creation of new blocks.
- On Sept.
- 15, the number of blocks created daily shot up by roughly 18% from approximately 6,000 blocks to 7,100 blocks per day.
- The average block time — the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions — for Ethereum dropped by over 13%, as evidenced by data from YCharts.
- Following the upgrade, GPU prices in China saw a significant drop as the blockchain moved away from the power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, according to a Chinese merchant.
