Binance's Proof of Reserves Statement When we say Proof of Reserves, we are specifically referring to those assets that we hold in custody for users. This

## Highlights

- Binance says an audit shows proof of reserves of customer funds.
- But its auditor will not vouch for the reserves nor the methodology demanded by Binance.
- Binance said it would begin releasing information about other crypto tokens in the coming weeks.
- The report didnâ€™t show total assets or total liabilities, but its scope was limited only to bitcoin assets and bitcoin liabilities.
- The first rule in telling the truth is "Don't lie", but the second rule in truth telling is to not sound like you are hiding something.
- This is especially important when overall trust is in the gutter anyway.
