Last year, a millionaire socialite Kim Kardashian promoted a scammy Ethereum-based coin called EthereumMax was promoted on Instagram.

## Highlights

- Kim Kardashian is still battling the lawsuit, which alleges she promoted the “pump and dump” token.
- Kardashian's defense is that the token buyers are only relying on two of her Instagram posts.
- She elaborates that in those posts, she didn’t offer investment advice.
- Also, token buyers haven't specified that they saw Kim Kardashian’s posts ahead of time or bought the EMAX tokens because of the posts, the filing said in the filing.
- The filing added that no named plaintiff alleges that they, in fact, viewed either Instagram post before purchasing tokens during the relevant time period," it is said in a statement.
