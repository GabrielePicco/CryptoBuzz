Crypto users can now move funds off its platform, a long-awaited feature similar to those of other popular services.

## Highlights

- PayPal announced Tuesday that crypto users can now move funds off its platform.
- The feature is a long-awaited feature that will make the company's offering more like those of other popular services.
- The ability to conduct external transfers on PayPal's crypto platform will start rolling out to users today and be available to everyone in the U.S.
- in the next week or two.
- A PayPal executive said the company is not backing off its ambitious crypto plans despite a financial downturn that's seen the financial giant's share price get battered in recent months.
- It's unclear for now how much crypto is contributing to PayPal's bottom line, especially as the company doesn't disclose how many people are using its service.
