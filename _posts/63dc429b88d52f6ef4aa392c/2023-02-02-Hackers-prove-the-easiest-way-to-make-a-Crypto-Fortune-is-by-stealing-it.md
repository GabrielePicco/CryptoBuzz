A record $3.8 billion of crypto was stolen last year, with $1.7 billion of that heading to North Korea.

## Highlights

- A new report reveals that hackers targeting cryptocurrency last year managed to steal a record $3.8 billion in digital coins.
- The majority of that was taken by finding vulnerabilities in bridge services (used to connect different blockchains) that form part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure cryptocurrency relies upon.
- North Korea has a particular expertise in this sector, with hacking groups linked to the country's government accounting for $1.7 billion of the total.
- For context, North Korea's gross domestic product hovers around the $29 billion mark.
- The US sanctioned Tornda Cash for laundering crypto funds for the country, hackers there were also behind the $100 million Harmony blockchain hack.
