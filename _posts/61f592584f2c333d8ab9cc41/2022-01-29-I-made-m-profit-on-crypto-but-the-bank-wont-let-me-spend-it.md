Imagine winning the lottery and not being able to spend the winnings. For Britain’s Bitcoin millionaires, who have made vast profits on cryptocurrencies, this is a reality, after being blocked from their own money.

## Highlights

- Digital currency traders sitting on huge gains have been turned away by banks.
- Banks fear they may be unwittingly taking money from law breakers who use digital currencies to hide wealth.
- Banks have set a number of hurdles for investors to jump before they can move their gains from crypto “digital wallets” to pounds and pence.
- It has proved a headache for young enthusiasts who have made vast fortunes, in some cases almost overnight, speculating on the prices of coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.
- Even those who successfully accessed their gains have faced hurdles purchasing property, as conveyancers have refused to work with them over money-laundering fears.
