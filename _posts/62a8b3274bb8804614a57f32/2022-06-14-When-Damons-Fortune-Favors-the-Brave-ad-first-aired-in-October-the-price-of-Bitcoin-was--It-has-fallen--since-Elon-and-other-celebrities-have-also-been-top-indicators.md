As the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, some are looking at the change in cryptocurrency prices since Matt Damon promoted Crypto.com.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin dropped below the $23,000 mark on Monday for the first time in years.
- The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has slumped and reached a low not seen since December 2020.
- People who were convinced to invest money into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies by ads featuring Matt Damon will have substantially less now than the day they invested.
- Bitcoin's decline has had an impact on other cryptocurrencies with the likes of Etherium, tether, BNB, Dogecoin and Cardano all facing gradual declines.
- Anyone wanting to return to the full value of their initial investment would need Bitcoin to increase by 170.58 percent to get back to their original investment.
