A Central Bank Digital Currency would enable a totalitarian nightmare

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Federal Reserve added another $2,000 in FedCoins to your account on Stimmie Day.
- The FedCoin is coded as usable for consumer purchases only, and will expire and vanish in seven days.
- So you'd better spend em while youâ€™ve got em, since the money is going to expire soon.
- The latest PlayBox it is then: Elden Ring 3 is the hottest VR game on the Metaverse right now, and you've really wanted to join in.
- But when you wave your phone to pay, an error message pops up again.
