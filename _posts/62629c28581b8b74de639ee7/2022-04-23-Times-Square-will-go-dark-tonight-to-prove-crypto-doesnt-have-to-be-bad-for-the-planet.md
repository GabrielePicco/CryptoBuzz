Algorand, a carbon-negative blockchain protocol, wants you to know it’s not an environmental villain, so it’s dimming NYC to get your attention.

## Highlights

- Algorand, a carbon-negative blockchain protocol, is doing just that by blacking out New York’s Times Square to conserve power.
- The same amount of energy that powers the square for 60 minutes would power just 1.5 seconds of Bitcoin network operation.
- But it could power 350 million transactions recorded on the protocol's ledger and two weeks’ worth of network liveliness, the group says.
- The group behind the protocol wants you to know it’re not an environmental villain, so it's dimming NYC to get your attention, it says.
- It will save roughly 23.4 billion joules of energy from the energy used to power the Times Square.
