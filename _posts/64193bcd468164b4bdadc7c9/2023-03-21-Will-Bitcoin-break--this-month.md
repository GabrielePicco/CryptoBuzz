- The worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency is around $28,030, with its market capitalisation having jumped 25.46% in the last seven days.
- The US Federal Reserve and five other major central banks are taking fresh measures to improve global liquidity as traditional financial markets remain jittery from the turmoil hitting the banking sector.
