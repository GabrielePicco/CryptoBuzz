Ethereum's blocks are being increasingly produced by so-called \"OFAC compliant\" MEV relays that are comfortable with censoring the blockchain

## Highlights

- 51% of blocks produced yesterday were built by so-called “OFAC compliant” MEV-Boost relays, meaning relays that have openly stated their intention to censor transactions related to Tornado Cash.
- The Office of Foreign Assets Control added the privacy protocol to its sanctions list on August 8, arguing it was solely being used by money launderers and North Korean cybercriminals.
- MEV, or “Maximum Extractable Value,” is a term used to describe arbitrage opportunities found by reordering transactions within a block while it is being produced.
- In the 24 hours before the time of writing, more than 57% of all Ethereum blocks were produced by MEV relays; of these, 88% openly stated they would refuse to include transactions in any way.
