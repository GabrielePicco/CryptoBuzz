- EST, up 1.6% over the past 10 hours.
- MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now in profit for the first time since June 2022.
- The company owns 140,000 bitcoins, at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.17 billion.
- Recent bitcoin purchases lowered the company's average purchase price to $29,803, which means it is technically up by a few hundreds dollars, but it likely wouldn't be able to sell all of its bitcoin for a profit yet if it wanted to.Shares in the firm are up 114% year-to-date, outperforming bitcoin, and are trading at  $312.78.
