Principal Accounts for Less than 5% of Withdrawals a Day After Shapella

## Highlights

- Stakers have largely withdrawn rewards accrued from their staking, rather than their principal.
- More than 95% of withdrawals were staking rewards, according to TokenUnlocks.
- The remaining 5% was usersâ€™ original stake, meaning those users had exited staking entirely.
- There are limits on the amount of Ether that can be withdrawn each day, and users and entities that would like to withdraw their principal have been placed in a queue.
- On the day after the upgrade, Ether topped $2,000 for the first time since May 2022, just before the collapse of DeFi protocol Terra.
- Experts believe the benefit of enabling withdrawals outweigh any sell pressure it might cause in the long-term.
