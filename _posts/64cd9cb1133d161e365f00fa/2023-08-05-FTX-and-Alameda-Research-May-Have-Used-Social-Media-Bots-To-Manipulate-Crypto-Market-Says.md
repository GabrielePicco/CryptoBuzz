New research finds that Twitter bot accounts may have lifted the prices of digital assets listed on embattled crypto exchange FTX and traded by its hedge fund arm, Alameda Research.

## Highlights

- New research finds that Twitter bot accounts may have lifted the prices of digital assets listed on embattled crypto exchange FTX and traded by its hedge fund arm, Alameda Research.
