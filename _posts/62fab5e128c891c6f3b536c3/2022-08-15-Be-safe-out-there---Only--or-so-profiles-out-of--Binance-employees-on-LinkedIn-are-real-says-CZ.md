Project owners can receive unsolicited listing offers on a near-daily basis.

## Highlights

- Only 50 out of 7,000 users claiming to be employees of world's largest cryptocurrency exchange on Linkedin are real, says Binance CEO.
- Scam typically begins as an unsolicited request from an apparent crypto exchange executive to project stakeholders regarding a potential token listing.
- Profiles are cleverly crafted to show years of experience in the industry, along with, multiple connections, sometimes up to 500-plus, to derive an image of apparent legitimacy.
- The scammer then sends a document via email or Telegram containing the details of the listing process along with a required initial security deposit for the "service" As soon as the victim transfers the requested digital assets to the deposit address, however, the scammer breaks off all contact and pockets the funds.
