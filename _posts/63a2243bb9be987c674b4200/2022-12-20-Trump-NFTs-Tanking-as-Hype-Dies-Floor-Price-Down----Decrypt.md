The floor price for the former U.S. president’s Polygon-based NFTs has dropped 74% since peaking on Saturday.

## Highlights

- Donald Trump's NFT trading cards were the talk of the crypto world late last week, captivating Twitter and late night TV in the process.
- But after prices and trading volume surged over the weekend, both metrics have fallen sharply.
- Trading volume fell 57% from Sunday to Monday, while the floor price for the NFTs has dropped 74% since the Saturday peak.
- Trump’s digital trading cards are minted on Polygon scaling network Polygon, and sold out within 24 hours and fueled secondary market demand.
- The Bored Ape Yacht Club tops the list of the top-selling projects with $3.8 million worth of NFT sales.
