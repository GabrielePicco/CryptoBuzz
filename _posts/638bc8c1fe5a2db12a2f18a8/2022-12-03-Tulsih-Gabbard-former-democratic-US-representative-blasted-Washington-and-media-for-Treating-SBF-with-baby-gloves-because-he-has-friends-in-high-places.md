Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" that the media's treatment of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is in stark contrast to the reporting on Elon Musk taking over Twitter.

## Highlights

- Tulsi Gabbard said the media's treatment of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is an example of "everything that's wrong" with Washington, D.C., elite and mainstream media, she said.
- She also said the reporting on Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter is a "national security threat" to the U.S.
- She said the mainstream media is treating Bankman Friedman with "kid gloves" and not calling him out for what he is, but on the other hand, Elon Musk is vilified because he stands for free speech.
- The American people deserve better than this, what is essentially a wealthy banana republic that takes care of their own
