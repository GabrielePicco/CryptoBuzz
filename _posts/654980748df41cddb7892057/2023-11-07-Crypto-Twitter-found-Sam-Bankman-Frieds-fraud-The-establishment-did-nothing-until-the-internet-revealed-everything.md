The establishment did nothing until the internet revealed everything.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried has been convicted, but the case was broken on crypto Twitter, from beginning to end.
- Not a single journalist, politician, regulator, or policeman thought to investigate SBF until Erik Voorhees smelled a rat and Ian Allison found the rat.
- Even the least self-aware corporate journalist in modern history admitted that citizen journalists “outshine traditional media on coverage of FTX implosion” The criminal justice system eventually succeeded, but only after failing everywhere else — and then too only after the Internet built the entire case for them.
- SBF’s stolen money helped swing elections across the country.
- These actions will never be unwound, which means SBF took one for the team — and the bad guys got away with it again
