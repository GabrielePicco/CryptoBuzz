Brazilian lawmakers have approved a complete regulatory framework for crypto, regulating the use of bitcoin as payment.

## Highlights

- New rules recognize bitcoin as a digital representation of value that can be used as a means of payment and as an investment asset in the South American nation.
- The bill only needs the Presidentâ€™s signature before it becomes law.
- It does not make bitcoin or any cryptocurrency a legal tender in the country.
- The Central Bank of Brazil will be in charge when bitcoin is used as payment, while the country's securities and exchange commission will be the watchdog when it is used for investment.
- A big miss was the rejection of a clause that sought to cut some state and federal taxes on purchases of bitcoin mining machines.
- It was apparently not enough to be approved.
