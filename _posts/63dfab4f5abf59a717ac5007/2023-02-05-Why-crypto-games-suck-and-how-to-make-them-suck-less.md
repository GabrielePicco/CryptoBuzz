The barrier of entry to the crypto ecosystem is relatively low in terms of capital: you can interact with almost any dApp with just a few bucks. The average gamer is a teenager who has a home console, has little to no money

## Highlights

- The barrier of entry to the crypto ecosystem is relatively low in terms of capital: you can interact with almost any dApp with just a few bucks.
- The barrier for gaming is becoming truly lower every day: someone who has a cheap smartphone can play beautiful, free to play games (which today are almost 1:1 ports of console games!)
- and enjoy a social experience at the same time — all while gaming on a $120 touchscreen (and in some cases even cheaper) The average gamer doesn’t have the patience to learn about technical knowledge and has little to no money to learn how to play a game.
- Crypto game devs and the respective VCs that fund them: who does your product cater to?
