Satishkumar Kurjibhai Kumbhani was indicted in San Diego in possibly the largest con of its kind to be criminally charged

## Highlights

- Satishkumar Kurjibhai Kumbhani, 36, is charged with wire fraud, money laundering and commodities fraud.
- He is accused of running BitConnect, the company he formed in 2016, as a “textbook Ponzi scheme,” prosecutors say.
- Investors were encouraged to buy BitConnect’s open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency, called BCC, using Bitcoin for the purchase.
- Investors would then “lend” their tokens to Bitconnect, which would purportedly invest the proceeds using proprietary technology known as the Trading Bot and Volatility Software.
- The value of BCC plummeted as the value of the cryptocurrency plummeted.
