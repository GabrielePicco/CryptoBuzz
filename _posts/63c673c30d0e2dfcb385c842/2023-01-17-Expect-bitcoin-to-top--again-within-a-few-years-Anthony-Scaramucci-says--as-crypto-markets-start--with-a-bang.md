Investors are piling back into crypto markets, with bitcoin jumping 26% and ethereum up 29% year-to-date.

## Highlights

- Anthony Scaramucci says 2023 will be a "recovery year" for digital assets.
- SkyBridge Capital founder says bitcoin will trade between $50,000 to $100,000 in two to three years' time.
- Investors are piling back into crypto markets, with bitcoin jumping 26% and ethereum up 29% year-to-date.
- But that rally has been nowhere near significant enough to recoup losses logged by the cryptocurrencies in 2022, Scaramuccu says.
- Rising interest rates and the implosion of high-profile companies like FTX and Celsius Network have weighed on demand for crypto.
- He said Monday he'll be investing his own money into former FTX chief Brett Harrison's new crypto start-up.
