## Highlights

- Bitcoin addresses holding more than 10 BTC on their balances touched a new two-year high.
- Bitcoin addresses over the last couple of months have been fluctuating between accumulation and dumping.
- But one important fact is that there has been consistent growth in 2023 despite the market being less than a week into the new year.
- This cohort had previously declined especially as the price of the digital asset had suffered multiple dips and crashes.
- The fact that addresses holding 1+ and 10+ BTC were recording such growth has no doubt had a positive impact on the price.
- BTC is currently changing hands at a price of $16,730 at the time of this writing.
