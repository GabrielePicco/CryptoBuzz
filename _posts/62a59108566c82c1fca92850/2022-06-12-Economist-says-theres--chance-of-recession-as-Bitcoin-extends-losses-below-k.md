## Highlights

- Professor of Applied Economics at John Hopkins University Steve Hanke believes that the soaring inflation is an indication the economy is going into recession.
- Hanke noted that chances of a recession stand at around 65% although he did not highlight any specific timelines noting that it all depends on the Federal Reserve.
- This comes after the inflation rate hit a record high of 8.6%, with pressure mounting on the Fed to intervene.
- According to the economist, the Fed is fully responsible for the inflation situation, stating that while enacting previous measures, especially on printing money, the institution had no idea how it might turn out.
- Inflation rates would likely stick around for a few years since the money supply is bound to keep increasing
