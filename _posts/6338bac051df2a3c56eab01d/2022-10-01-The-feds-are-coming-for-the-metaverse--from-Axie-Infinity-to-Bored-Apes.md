NFTs in the metaverse should generally be considered securities, but developers have been slow to recognize that fact. Expect a regulatory reckoning to come swiftly for Axie Infinity, Bored Apes, and other projects that have thrown caution to the wind.

## Highlights

- The metaverse is a futuristic iteration of the internet featuring a digital economy and an immersive virtual environment alongside other interactive features.
- By 2024, estimates suggest that by 2024, its total valuation could top $800 billion.
- With great valuations comes great scrutiny from increasingly tech-savvy financial regulators.
- Cybercriminals are continually discovering new tactics to exploit users of the metaverse.
- Privacy concerns abound as three-dimensional data sets will reveal increasingly sensitive personal information.
- Metaverse platforms need to fill even greater regulatory scrutiny, given the sensitivity of the data they collect and could face even greater scrutiny.
