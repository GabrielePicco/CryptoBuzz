Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented that ZK-Rollups will dominate the Layer 2 space in the coming years.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin predicts ZK-Rollups will beat Optimistic Rollups in the Layer 2 scaling wars.
- Optimistic rollup technology is more mature than Zero-knowledge Rollup technology, he said.
- ZK Rollups are faster when moving funds to and from the mainnet, which may lead to wider adoption of them.
- The ZK technology is yet to mature and is hard to build on, he added, but may change soon since EVM compatibility for ZK rollups is in the works.
- The developer said he expects the Rollups to be all ZK in 10 years from now or even more, in the coming years.
