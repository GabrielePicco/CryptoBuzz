The Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges against Douver Torres Braga, Joff Paradise, Keleionalani Akana Taylor, and Jonathan Tetreault for their roles in Trade Coin Club, a fraudulent crypto Ponzi scheme.

## Highlights

- Braga and Paradise lured investors with false representations that the bot made ‘millions of microtransactions’ every second, and that investors would receive minimum returns of 0.35 percent daily.
- The SEC filed a second complaint alleging that Jonathan Tetreault violated the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.
- The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.
- The settlement is subject to Court approval.
- The investigation was conducted by Serafima K. McTigue of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Victor Hong.
