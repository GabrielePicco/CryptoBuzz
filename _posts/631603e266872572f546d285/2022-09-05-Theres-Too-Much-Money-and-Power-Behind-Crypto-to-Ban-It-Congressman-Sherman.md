The US government can not ban cryptocurrencies in the foreseable future since the sector has gathered too much money and power, Sherman stated.

## Highlights

- Congressman Brad Sherman is firmly against cryptocurrencies.
- In his view, it undermines the dominance of the American dollar and is a threat to national security.
- Sherman does not believe the government can prohibit the asset class “anytime soon” since there is too much money and power behind it.
- The US government can not ban cryptocurrencies in the foreseable future since the sector has gathered too much power and money, Sherman stated.
- Sherman went further describing cryptocurrency investments as a Ponzi scheme since the majority of investors buy digital assets only to sell them later at a higher price: "Cryptocurrency is a meme you invest in, in the hopes that you can sell it to somebody else before it tanks"
