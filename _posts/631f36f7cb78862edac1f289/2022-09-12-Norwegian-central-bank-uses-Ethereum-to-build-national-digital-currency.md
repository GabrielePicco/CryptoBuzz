Norway is moving forward with CBDC testing plans, releasing the open source code for the country’s CBDC sandbox on GitHub.

## Highlights

- The central bank of Norway has released open source code for the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) sandbox.

- The current version of the code does not support the major Ethereum wallet MetaMask by design and is only privately accessible by users with appropriate credentials.
- The Norges Bank announced plans to conduct CBDC tests in April last year, expecting to find a preferred CBDC solution by trialing different designs for a period of two years.
- In November 2021, the central bank issued a working paper referring to possible CBDC designs, including those based on Bitcoin and Bitcoin.
