While a digital dollar is still likely years away, the U.S. government seems to be warming up to the idea of issuing its own CBDC.

## Highlights

- A “digital dollar” central bank digital currency would radically change how the world interacts with money.
- Authorities have warmed up to the idea in months since President Joe Biden's executive order directing dozens of government agencies to develop reports on crypto policy.
- A CBDC would offer some benefits but also grant the Treasury and Federal Reserve unprecedented powers over the freedom to transact.
- The idea behind CBDCs is to introduce a new form of money that resembles commercial bank money in that it’s purely digital and directly accessible to the public, but at the same time is issued by and issued by the Fed (like cash) instead by commercial banks (like bank deposits)
