The unnamed man worked reasonably succesfully as a content creator but saw his salary rise from around £25,000 to ten times that amount when he took a punt on virtual trading in 2014

## Highlights

- Unnamed man became multi-millionaire after taking a 'lucky bet' on Bitcoin in 2014.
- His salary rose from £25,000 to ten times that amount when he took a punt on virtual trading.
- Despite the risk involved, he discovered Bitcoin and "fell down a deep rabbit hole" He was able to cash out more than £2 million after tax in 2017.
- But he says he feels like he's used a "cheat code" and doesn't deserve the fortune.
- The investor said he never acquired a taste for expensive things when he lived more frugally, and instead saved a chunk of his salary each year.
- He says he now has a two-fold problem as he cannot "recreate" the excitement of his life with just money.
