With absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic IDO’s of Starlay and Arthswap and absolute messes of launches the program is in need of some adjustment.  While IDO’s and price action can not be assured against losing money, r…

## Highlights

- With absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic IDO’s of Starlay and Arthswap and absolute messes of launches the program is in need of some adjustment.
- Moonbeam and Astar are 2 of the 3 flagship projects for Polkadot.
- While IDO's and price action can not be assured against losing money, realistic evaluations can be made to protect investors.
- The comedy of errors by both, but really IMO even more egregious by the ARSW team, is a reflection on Astar.
- I did not participate in either IDO.
- It is not a good look on the ecosystem in general.
