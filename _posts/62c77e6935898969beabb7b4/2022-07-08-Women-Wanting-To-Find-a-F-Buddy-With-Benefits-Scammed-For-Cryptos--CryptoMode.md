Qiao Er a Chinese woman, was one of the many women who fell for this crypto-coin love scam while she was trying to find a fuck buddy

## Highlights

- There have been reports of a shocking number of women being scammed out of their hard-earned money by men pretending to be interested in a woman looking to find a fuck buddy.
- In many cases, the perpetrators will post a lavish lifestyle, on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.
- They then message unsuspecting victims and start months-long online romance.
- Their operations are very calculative, they take their time to make the victims fall in love and show them how lavish they are living before ‘going for the kill’ The Chinese government is trying to curb this growing menace which they term a ‘pig butchering’ scam.
