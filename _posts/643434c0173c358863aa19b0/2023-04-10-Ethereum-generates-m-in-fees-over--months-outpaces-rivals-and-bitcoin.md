Ethereum dominates the world of blockchain fee generation, with reports indicating it has generated over $743 million in cumulative daily fees over the past six months, more than twice that of its nearest competitor. This underscores Ethereum's robust adoption and growth.

## Highlights

- ETH (ETH) continues to be the top dog when it comes to generating fees in the blockchain world, signaling its unwavering adoption and growth.
- ETH has generated over $743 million in cumulative daily fees over the past six months, more than twice that of its nearest competitor.
- TRON generated less than half at $282 million, with bitcoin (BTC) generating just under $80 million during the same period.
- Low average transaction fees are still challenging for non-whale users, who may prefer to explore alternative networks.
- Layer-2 networks have emerged as a promising solution to address high transaction costs, with Arbitrum One ranking sixth-highest in terms of fees.
