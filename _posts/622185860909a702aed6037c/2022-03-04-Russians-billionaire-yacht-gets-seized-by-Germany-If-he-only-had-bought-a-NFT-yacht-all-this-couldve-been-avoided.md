According to the Ministry for Economy and Innovation in the German state of Hamburg, the country’s authorities have not seized the 512-foot Dilbar, but the yacht is not allowed to leave.

## Highlights

- Alisher Usmanov's 512-foot yacht Dilbar has been in the shipyards of Blohm+Voss since October.
- The German Ministry of Economic Affairs confirmed to Forbes that the yacht is still in the dock at the Hamburg shipyard.
- Sources in the yacht industry say the German government froze the asset and that the ship has been frozen.
- At 15,917 tons, the Dilbar boasts the largest swimming pool ever installed on a yacht as well as two helicopter pads, a sauna, a beauty salon, and a gym.
- The yacht is registered in the Cayman Islands and owned through a holding company, making it difficult to tie directly to USmanov.
