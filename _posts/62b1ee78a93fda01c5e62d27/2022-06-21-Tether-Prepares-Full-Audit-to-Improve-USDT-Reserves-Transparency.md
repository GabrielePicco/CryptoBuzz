Tether, the world's largest stablecoin with $68 billion in assets, will undertake a full audit to improve transparency.

## Highlights

- Tether, the worldâ€™s largest stablecoin with $68 billion in assets, will undertake a full audit with a top 12 accounting firm to improve transparency of its USDT reserves.
- The move comes as USDT has steadily lost market share following a series of redemptions over the past few weeks, caused in part by weakening confidence after the collapse of the Terra blockchain last month.
- Tether is providing regular updates on its reserves and operations to the New York Attorney General Letitia James, as part of a deal on an $18.5 million settlement and a ban on trading in Feb last year.
- Chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino claimed that, practically, USDT never de-pegged after the company paid users $1 to redeem their USDT holdings.
