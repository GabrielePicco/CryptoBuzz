Talking about them is essential to make people understand that helping them is the best way to support the Bitcoin revolution.

## Highlights

- Electric Capital's "2022 Developer Report" is an opportunity to see in more detail how many developers are working on Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin's network has grown to more than 200 million users, yet Bitcoin has never had the financial backing of governments or large investment banks.
- On average about 100 developers have been joining Bitcoin projects every month since November 2017: This is a good thing because some people get bored and prefer to move on to other projects.
- So there must be always new developers contributing.
- The biggest drop is in the one-time contributors to Bitcoin, which is less serious in my opinion.
- Their drop is -32% between December 2021 and December 2022.
