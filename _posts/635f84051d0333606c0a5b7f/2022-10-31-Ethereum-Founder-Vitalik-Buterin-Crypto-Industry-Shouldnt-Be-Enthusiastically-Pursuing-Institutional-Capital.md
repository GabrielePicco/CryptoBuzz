\"Should I publicly blab my opinions about crypto regulation more?\" he asks. \"Feels unfair to let other people get attacked.\"

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin: Regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally, he says.
- He is skeptical of requiring DeFi protocol front-ends to abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) standards.
- The Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet on approving a spot-based Bitcoin-ETF-like trust in 2013.
- The SEC has yet to approve a Bitcoin-like Bitcoin ETF, which some say is too late for the crypto industry.
- The S&E has not yet approved a Bitcoin ETF.
