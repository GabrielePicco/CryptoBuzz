A range of cryptocurrencies fell sharply this morning, leaving multiple altcoins in the top 100 with 20-25% losses.

## Highlights

- EOS, Polygon and Dash each lost between 24% and 25% this morning.
- The biggest losses in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap were EOS and Dash.
- Many of the tokens that fell the most were also named as securities in the recent lawsuits by the Securities and Exchanges Commission against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.
- Bitcoin and Ether were less affected but still saw 3% and 5% declines.
- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao dismissed one reason for the market crash on Twitter today.
- He said instead that the exchange's stablecoin reserves — used to pay salaries and expenses — had decreased and that its crypto reserves had increased.
