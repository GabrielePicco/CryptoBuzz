Returning only 2.2% of the funds back to the bankrupt estate could be seen as a political calculation rather than a moral one.

## Highlights

- Democrats to Return 2.2% of $45.2 million donation made by FTX's Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
- The Democratic National Committee is setting aside $815,000 to return to the now-defunct crypto exchange.
- The bankrupt estate is now asking for the $45 million given to Democratic candidates, political action committees, and Biden to be returned to the company so it can pay back creditors.
- According to Federal Election Commission records and data from opensecrets.org, SBF gave Democrats at least $40 million in donations.
- Tesla CEO Elon Musk has suggested that SBF may have given significantly more to Democrats over the years, possibly even $1 billion.
