Developers merged Ropsten's proof-of-work chain with its beacon chain.

## Highlights

- Developers activate merge on Ropsten test network to prepare for mainnet merge of Ethereum.
- The merge took place on Wednesday afternoon after the move was first announced on June 3.
- The same process is set to happen later this year with the Ethereum mainnet merging, for which a date has not yet been set.
- The test is measured by a metric called terminal total difficulty, and is considered activated once this level of block difficulty is reached on the proof of work version.
- The proof-of-work version crossed a pre-set 50 quadrillion measure to protect the merge from any malicious activity by artificially acquiring the hashrate.
- The merging was intended to serve as a major practice session for the merge.
