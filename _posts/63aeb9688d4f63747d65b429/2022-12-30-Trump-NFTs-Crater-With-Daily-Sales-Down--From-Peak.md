Demand for the ex-president’s Polygon NFTs has disappeared, with sales volume and prices both falling sharply.

## Highlights

- Donald Trump's NFT trading cards have lost momentum, with sales volume and value down sharply from respective peaks.
- Sales volume on Wednesday was 98% lower than on the peak day less than two weeks ago.
- The NFTs are the 69th best-selling project over the past 24 hours, with just over $44,000 in sales during that span.
- Trump’s initial NFT sale raked in over $4 million and sold out within 24 hours.
- All told, the project has generated about $9.8 million to date in secondary trading volume, with Trump taking a 10% cut of sales made through marketplaces that honor creator royalties.
