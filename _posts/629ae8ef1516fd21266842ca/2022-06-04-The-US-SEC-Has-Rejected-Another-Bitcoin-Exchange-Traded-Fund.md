The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected a recent proposal for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. However, many other asset management firms are still seeking to become the first to gain approval for their own proposals.

## Highlights

- The SEC has rejected a proposal for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.
- However, many other asset management firms are still seeking to gain approval for their own proposals.
- The SEC rejected One River Asset Managementâ€™s proposal for its Bitcoin ETF, which was called the Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust.
