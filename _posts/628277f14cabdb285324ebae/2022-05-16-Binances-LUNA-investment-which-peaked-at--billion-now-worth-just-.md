Even though Binance lost nearly all of its initial investment, it still turned a profit from its staking yield.

## Highlights

- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the crypto exchange made large paper gains on its investment in Luna but has now lost practically all of them.
- At Luna's peak price, that investment was worth $1.6 billion, according to Zhao.
- Yet that investment has now plummeted in value to just $3,400.
- Binance received $10.3 million worth of UST in staking rewards, which would be worth $74 million if UST was holding its peg to the dollar and not trading at its current value of $0.13.
- Even though Binance lost nearly all of its initial investment, it still turned a profit from its staking yield.
