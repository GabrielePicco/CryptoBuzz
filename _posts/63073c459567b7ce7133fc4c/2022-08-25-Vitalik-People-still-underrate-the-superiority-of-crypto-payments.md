Increasing adoption from retail giants, the prevalence of stablecoins and the convenience of crypto cards mean that cryptocurrencies may be a better form of payment than one may think.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin says cryptocurrencies are often underrated in payments.
- He says it's because they're more convenient to use internationally and within countries.
- Cryptocurrency use in payments has been growing in recent months.
- Some businesses are already adopting crypto payments to find and gain new customers.
- Not everyone has been as bullish about the use of cryptocurrencies as means of payment, with common objections including price volatility and high-transaction fees and long processing times for certain cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) As of Wednesday, the Bitcoin blockchain handles approximately five transactions per second (TPS), and averages fees of $0.819 as of Wednesday.
