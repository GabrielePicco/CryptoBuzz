Some Monero proponents are calling for a boycott of MineXMR as the mining pool approaches 51% hash rate control.

## Highlights

- Monero mining pool MineXMR now controls 44% of the privacy coinâ€™s hash rate.
- If it were to reach such a level, it could theoretically be able to carry out a 51% attack on the network.
- Some Monero proponents are calling for a boycott of the mining pool as it approaches 51% hash rate control.
- The position is a position that allows one entity to have sway over the network's consensus on what transactions have gone through and how they have done so.
- Some say it could be dangerous for the security of the Monero network, especially if miners migrate to other pools to prevent such a threat to the system.
