The chief executive of Coinbase is making it crystal clear to stakeholders that the top US-based crypto exchange has no investments in its troubled competitor FTX.

## Highlights

- Brian Armstrong tells his 1.1 million Twitter followers that Coinbase has zero “material exposure” to FTX, its native FTX Token (FTT) or its sister company Alameda Research.
- Armstrong’s statements come amid the abrupt collapse of the embattled crypto exchange FTX.
- Its native asset FTT is also in the midst of a total meltdown, plunging nearly 75% in the last 24 hours.
- According to Armstrong, FTX's struggles highlight the need for a more transparent crypto ecosystem with DeFi [decentralized finance] and self-custodial wallets that don’t rely on trusting third parties.
