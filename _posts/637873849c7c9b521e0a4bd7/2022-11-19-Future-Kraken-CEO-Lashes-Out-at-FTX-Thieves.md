This is not the first time Kraken Leadership has spoken out against FTX and its former CEO.

## Highlights

- Kraken COO David Ripley has spoken out against FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.
- Ripley dismissed rumors that FTX had approached Kraken in the hopes of a possible buyout.
- Binance and Voyager Digital backed out of a deal to buy FTX, citing issues at FTX.
- FTX will be in the same position as Voyager Digital, which they had previously planned to bail out of the market.
- The company's COO claims there was never any serious discussion on acquiring FTX at any point.
- With two of the biggest players on the crypto market turning their backs, a potential buyout seems less likely.
