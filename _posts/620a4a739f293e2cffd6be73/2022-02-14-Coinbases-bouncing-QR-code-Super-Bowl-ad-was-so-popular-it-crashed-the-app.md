Coinbase’s clever, DVD-inspired QR code Super Bowl commercial promoted the service with a free sign up and $3 million giveaway, but was also so popular that it crashed the company’s app.

## Highlights

- Coinbase's Super Bowl Super Bowl ad features a bouncing, bouncing QR code that brings viewers to the company’s promotional website.
- New customers have until February 15th to get the $15 promotion.
- The company's app is currently down, presumably due to the massive influx of traffic from the ad.
- Other companies, like Meta, were quick to jump on the company's bit.com and FTX, using the big game to promote either cryptocurrency exchanges, NFTs, or other related projects.
- The ad was so popular that it crashed its app, causing it to be temporarily knocked out of the service's app following the Super Bowl.
