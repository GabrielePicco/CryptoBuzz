## Highlights

- Immutable and Polygon are collaborating on a new project to change the face of blockchain gaming that will be powered by zkEVM technology.
- The alliance will improve game development for gaming studios using new scaling technology built by both projects.
- Immutable would rely on Polygon’s infrastructure to circumnavigate the nagging congestion issues without the need to expend resources in building its architecture.
