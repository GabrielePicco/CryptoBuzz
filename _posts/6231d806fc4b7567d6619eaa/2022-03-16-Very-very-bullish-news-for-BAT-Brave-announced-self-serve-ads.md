Brave announced self serve ads for the first time. The ads dashboard is available as a demo, and i am sure this will propel Brave up to new levels.

## Highlights

- Brave announced self serve ads in the last weekly Brave Community call.
- The ads dashboard is available as a demo, and i am sure this will propel Brave and its token BAT up to new levels!
- It means that to run ad campaigns, companies can do it themselves in this dashboard now.
- No more need to run every campaign through Brave first.
- It will increase the amount of ads and in turn attract more users and companies to the Brave ecosystem.
