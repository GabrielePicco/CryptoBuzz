FTX CEO John J. Ray III plans to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- FTX CEO John J. Ray III plans to tell the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the cryptocurrency exchange under Sam Bankman-Fried went on a $5 billion "spending binge" Ray's opening remarks validate some details about the collapse that have been previously reported by media outlets.
- FTX made more than $1 billion in "loans and other payments...to insiders" Alameda Research used client funds to do margin trading, exposing them to "massive losses" FTX went on "a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them," Ray says in his opening remarks.
