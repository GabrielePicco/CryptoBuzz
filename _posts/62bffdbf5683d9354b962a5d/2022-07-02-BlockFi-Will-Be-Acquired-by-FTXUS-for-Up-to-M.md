FTX.US is buying BlockFi for $240 million, Zac Prince has announced. The crypto lender will also receive $400 million in credit.

## Highlights

- BlockFi CEO Zac Prince announced on Twitter Friday that FTX.US is buying the firm for $240 million.
- The firm will also receive a $400 million rolling credit facility from FT.US.
- The price tag marks a heavy discount from BlockFiâ€™s previous valuation of $4.8 billion.
- The news comes off the back of a rocky June for BlockFi, which was one of several firms to liquidate Three Arrows Capital after it failed to meet a margin call when the market crashed.
- BlockFi suffered losses of $80 million in the aftermath of the collapse of Three Arrows, which led to a wave of withdrawals as customers lost faith in lending services, sparking its own insolvency crisis.
