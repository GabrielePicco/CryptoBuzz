Tether's circulating supply has slipped from about $83 billion a week ago to less than $76 billion on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Tether's circulating supply has slipped from about $83 billion a week ago to less than $76 billion on Tuesday.
- The so-called stablecoin is meant to always be worth $1.
- On Thursday, its price slipped as low as 95 cents amid panic over a rival token called terraUSD.
- Previously, Tether claimed all its tokens were backed 1-to-1 by dollars stored in a bank.
- However, after a settlement with the New York attorney general, the company revealed it relied on a range of other assets, including commercial paper, to support its token.
- Tether has faced repeated calls for a full audit of its reserves.
