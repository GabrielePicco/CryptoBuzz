A victim in Singapore has filed a report with the police, accusing Do Kwon of Terra, of running a Ponzi scheme.

## Highlights

- A victim in Singapore has filed a police report with the police, accusing Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon of running a Ponzi scheme.
- He claims that over 1,000 LUNA and UST holders have been left holding mud.
- This follows the de-pegging of UST and the crashing of LUNA, the governance and utility token of the Terra ecosystem.
- The result of the sell-off saw the crypto market lose hundreds of billions of dollars in value.
- The victim calls for the Terra CEO to refund victims with money he earned from his LUNA holdings.
- He recommends that Singaporean authorities freeze the CEOâ€™s assets before he flees overseas.
