A new service offers a way to offset losses from NFTs during a grim crypto winter that saw demand for digital collectibles vanish

## Highlights

- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are an electronic identifier confirming a digital collectible is real.
- The appetite for NFTs is so diminished that a specialized market has sprung up for collectors looking to sell off their once-valuable ‘digital collectibles’ as tax losses to offset their income tax bills.
- A recently launched service, Unsellable, aims to help collectors do exactly that.
- It buys the underlying tokens for a fraction of their original price and provides an official receipt for tax purposes.
- Justin Bieber paid $1.29m (£1m) for a “Bored Ape” NFT, a graphic of a bored ape.
