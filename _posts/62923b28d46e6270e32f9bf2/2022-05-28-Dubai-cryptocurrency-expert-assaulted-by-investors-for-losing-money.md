Six people hit victim, stole his money, watches and jewellery after millions lost in trade

## Highlights

- Six people sentenced to six months in jail for assaulting a Dubai-based cryptocurrency consultant and stealing his money.
- They lost millions of dirhams while trading with him in the digital currency.
- The six defendants stole three expensive watches and a diamond ring - worth Dh390,000 and $200,000 (Dh735,600) - before fleeing the consultant’s home in Dubai.
- The defendants had earlier met him and asked for advise on a crypto coin called ‘Fantom’.
- They later came to his house and were hysteric.
- They threatened me and later punched me in the face.
