SEC chair Gary Gensler proposed sweeping reforms that would alter the nature of crypto exchanges' institutional and investor custody programs.

## Highlights

- The Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-1 on Wednesday to propose sweeping changes to federal regulations that would expand custody rules to include assets like crypto and require companies to gain or maintain registration in order to hold those customer assets.
- Current federal regulations only include assets under the custody of an investment advisor.
- The move poses a fresh threat to crypto exchange custody programs, as other federal regulators actively discourage custodians like banks from holding customer crypto assets.
- The amendments also come as the SEC aggressively accelerates enforcement attempts against crypto institutions like Coinbase, which is the only publicly traded pure crypto exchange in the U.S., including state-chartered trust companies like Gemini and Gemini.
