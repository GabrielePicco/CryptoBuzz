At the time in 2010, bitcointalk.org member “Doublec,” published a post noting that he was able to get Bitcoind running on a Nokia N900.

## Highlights

- First phone-to-phone bitcoin transaction occurred more than 11 years ago on December 7, 2010.
- Satoshi Nakamoto’s simplified payment verification (SPV) concept was not available until two years later, after the former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn published BitcoinJ in 2011.
- The Bitcoin network has been functional 99.98777985271% of the time since its inception on January 3, 2009.
- The average time to generate a block on phones is 2,869 days at the current difficulty level of 8,078.
- That's almost eight years, so I’m not holding my breath,” bitcointalk.org member Ribuck said.
