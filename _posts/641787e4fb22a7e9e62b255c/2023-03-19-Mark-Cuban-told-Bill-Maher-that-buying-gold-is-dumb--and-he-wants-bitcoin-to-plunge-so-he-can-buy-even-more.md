Is crypto really the new gold?

## Highlights

- Mark Cuban told Bill Maher that buying gold is ‘dumb’ — and he wants bitcoin to plunge so he can buy even more.
- Cuban, who self-claims to be “very anti-bitcoin,” owns gold instead.
- Cuban: “I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.” If you want to buy Bitcoin, just buy Bitcoin.
- There are a few ways to gain exposure to bitcoin, including exchange-traded funds, bitcoin stocks and bitcoin miners.
- When more people buy, sell and use crypto, these platforms stand to benefit from the rise of crypto.
