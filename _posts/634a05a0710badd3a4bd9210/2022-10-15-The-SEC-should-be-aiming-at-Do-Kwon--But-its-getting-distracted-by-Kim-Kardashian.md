Do Kwon should be front-and-center for scrutiny from regulators. Instead, they’re getting distracted by grandstanding over Kim Kardashian.

## Highlights

- In less than a week, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon’s passport will expire.
- Kwon seems to be living a life of freedom while enjoying his internet access.
- The last thing we need in this time of turbulence for global markets is uncertainty driven by shady and (allegedly) criminal actors.
- Kim Kardashian shilling crypto is the tip of the iceberg, writes Cointe Cacac Colbert.
- The SEC has been highly vocal in reprimanding Kim Kardashian and other celebrities for shilling cryptocurrency projects, but bad actors like Kwon continue to elude the long arm of regulatory bodies, he says.
- Caczac Colbert is a digital marketer by night and a freelance writer
