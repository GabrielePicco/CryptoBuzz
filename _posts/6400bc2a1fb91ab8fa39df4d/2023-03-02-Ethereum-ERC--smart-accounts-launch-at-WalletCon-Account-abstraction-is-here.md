Crypto finally gets user friendly, with the ERC-4337 “account abstraction” standard meaning new users can join any EVM-compatible blockchain without understanding seed phrases, private keys or transaction signing.

## Highlights

- Smart accounts enabled by the launch of the new ERC-4337 standard, are now available on Ethereum.
- They are expected to help mainstream adoption by making crypto user friendly.
- The new 'account abstraction' standard also enables the use of two-factor authentication; signing transactions on your phone using a fingerprint or face-scan; and the setting of monthly spending limits on an account.
- The standard has been in development for two years with the team funded via grants from the Ethereum Foundation.
- The technology has already been incorporated into natively zkup and zkSync solutions designed an automated payment system that makes use of an automated bill payment system.
