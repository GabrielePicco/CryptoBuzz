Bitcoin lines up a battle between a golden cross and a death cross, with BTC price sideways at $23,000.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) lingered near $23,000 on Feb.
- 7 as a 'golden cross' on the daily chart hit for the first time in 18 months.
- The last time this occurred on daily timeframes was in September 2021 — two months before Bitcoin’s latest all-time high.
- Bitcoin lines up a battle between a golden cross and a “death cross” for its conversely detrimental impact on BTC price action.
- An upcoming “countercross” on weekly timeframes remained on course to drop below the 200-period one.
- The only key factor to watch is the U.S.
