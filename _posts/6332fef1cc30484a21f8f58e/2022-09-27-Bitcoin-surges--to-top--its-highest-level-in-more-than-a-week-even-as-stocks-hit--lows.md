Bitcoin topped $20,000 on Tuesday, hitting its highest level in the more than a week, but is still struggling to break out of its tight trading range.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range of $18,000 to $25,000 mark.
- The U.S.
- Federal Reserve's 0.75 percentage point rate hike last week marked a "major event" for crypto markets.
- Higher interest rates have put pressure on the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has filtered through other risky assets including cryptocurrencies.
- Bitcoin moves inversely to the dollar, so a strong greenback is negative for bitcoin.
- The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, is up more than 18% this year.
