Japan intends to further relax cryptocurrency regulations by making it easier to list virtual coins that would attract more people towards it

## Highlights

- Japan intends to further relax cryptocurrency regulations by making it easier to list virtual coins that would attract more people towards it.
- The organization that regulates cryptocurrency exchanges intends to enable them to list coins without going through its rigorous screening process.
- The loosened rule could go into effect as early as December.
- The countryâ€™s actions contrast with the stronger oversight emerging in other jurisdictions following a $2 trillion drop in digital assets from last year's peak, which resulted in blowups at crypto hedge funds and lenders.
- Binance, the largest digital asset exchange in the world, is again seeking a licence to operate in Japan, in part due to the shift in perspective.
