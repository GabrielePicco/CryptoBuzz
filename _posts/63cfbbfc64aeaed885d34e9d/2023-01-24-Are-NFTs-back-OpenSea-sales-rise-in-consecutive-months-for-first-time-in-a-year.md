Top marketplace OpenSea has already beaten December's Ethereum NFT sales volume tally this month amid other positive signs.

## Highlights

- Top marketplace OpenSea has already beaten December's NFT sales volume this month.
- January sales volume already topped December's tally of about $283.5 million.
- December was the first time since April 2022 that OpenSea had posted any kind of sales increase.
- The last time the marketplace had two straight months of sales volume growth (measured in USD) was across December 2021 and January 2022.

- The market has lost considerable momentum over the last year, but any upward movement is sure to be seen as good news by traders and builders.
