The Hex token created by Richard Heart does not pay legit interest. Read this original report and skip the copycats about why you should avoid this scam

## Highlights

- Richard Heart’s Hex Token is a Brilliant Scam.
- The controversial cryptocurrency token should go down in the crypto textbooks as one of the greatest cryptocurrency scams in history.
- It is heavily marketed with a large shilling army, has a high interest rate ‘hook’ to draw investors in, and its main product feature is to create resistance to getting out of it.
- It's the only cryptocurrency that I have ever heard of to use ads to market in magazines, buses, taxis, physical mail, hold shady airport seminars, and use TV to bring in a whole new class of victims outside the regular cryptocurrency speculators.
- The website advertises itself as a place to earn 40% per year with “certificates of deposit”
