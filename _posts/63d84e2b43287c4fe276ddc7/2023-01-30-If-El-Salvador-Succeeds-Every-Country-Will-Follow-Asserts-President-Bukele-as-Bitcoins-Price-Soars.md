El Salvador’s pro-bitcoin president Nayib Bukele has continued to defend his administration from attacks, telling off detractors

## Highlights

- Nayib Bukele has continued to defend his administration from attacks, telling off detractors who wish to pressure and reverse his socio-economic policies and Bitcoin agenda.
- The 41-year-old leader went on to label the numerous stories put out by legacy media outlets about how Bitcoin has destroyed his nation’s economy as “false” According to him, even if El Salvador lost $50 million selling Bitcoin as they claimed, it was foolish for far-right activists and media to claim such an amount could ruin the nation's economy.
- The comments come after El Salvador paid off an $800 million maturing bond plus interest last week, making him the most popular leader in the region.
