The ancient, near-defunct electronics store's brand is now a worthless coin called $RADIO, and its promoters are going HAM.

## Highlights

- RadioShack's Twitter account became a veritable trove of NSFW material this week.
- Tweets included musings about vibrators, "big tittes," and tweets trolling celebrities and other corporate accounts.
- The electronics store's brand is now a worthless coin called $RADIO, which is currently worth $0.009866.
- The company filed for bankruptcy in 2015, but a majority of its assets were purchased by a firm called Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV) which promised to rehabilitate it.
- The tweets were ostensibly an effort to promote this new venture.
- REV did not immediately respond to our request for comment.
