title:  "Bankman-Fried charges should not be tossed, prosecutors say"
description: "U.S. prosecutors on Monday said they opposed a motion by former cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried to dismiss criminal charges accusing him of stealing billions of dollars from customers to plug losses at his hedge fund.  Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old founder of FTX Trading, has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court to 13 counts of fraud, conspiracy, making illegal campaign contributions and foreign bribery.  On May 8, Bankman-Fried urged U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to dismiss most of the counts, saying prosecutors charged him in a \"rush to judgment\" after several prominent crypto companies went bankrupt in 2022, including his own Alameda Research."
