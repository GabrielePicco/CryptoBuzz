Algorand, via C3 protocol, is unleashing a groundbreaking scaling solution to Ethereum — and it may be rolled out at ETHDenver.

## Highlights

- The devs over at Algorand have found a way to scale ETH without an EVM.
- Coincidentally, Algo’s CEO has been teasing a major announcement coming at ETHDenver.
- The project is backed by some of the biggest suits in the game, including Digital Currency Group, Arrington Capital, and Jump Capital.
- The solution is more than novel, in theory it is more efficient and effective than other scaling solutions.
- C3 is more focused on cross-chain settlement and collateral management, it is not quite a “bridge” to Ethereum in the traditional sense.
- It is bridging, but without the trust, meaning the risk.
