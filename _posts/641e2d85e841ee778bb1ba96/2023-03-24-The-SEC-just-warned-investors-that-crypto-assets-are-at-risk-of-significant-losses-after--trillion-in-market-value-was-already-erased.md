\"The only money you should put at risk with any speculative investment is money you can afford to lose entirely,\" the SEC warned.

## Highlights

- SEC warned that cryptocurrencies could still spur significant losses for investors.
- "The only money you should put at risk with any speculative investment is money you can afford to lose entirely," the SEC warned.
- The warning comes just one day after the SEC sent a Wells notice to Coinbase, indicating the largest US cryptocurrency exchange could be sued by the agency for potential securities violations related to its asset listings and staking products.
- The SEC also highlighted that no crypto exchanges are registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer, exchange, or investment adviser â€” so investors may not get the protections afforded by the rules applicable to these entities, the SEC said.
- "Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure retail investors into scams," it warned.
