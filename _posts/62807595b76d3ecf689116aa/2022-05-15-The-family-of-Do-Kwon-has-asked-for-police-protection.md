The family of Do Kwon, the face behind LUNA and UST cryptocurrencies, is asking for police protection after a recent break-in.

## Highlights

- The family of Do Kwon, the lead of the Terraform Labs behind two top cryptocurrencies, LUNA and UST, has asked for police protection after a recent break-in.
- A stranger reportedly visited their apartment on the evening of May 12 and rang the doorbell.
- On responding, the intruder asked Donâ€™s spouse whether the CEO was in the house before fleeing.
- It is unclear whether the stranger was an investor of LUNA, UST or both.
- The two cryptocurrencies have tanked, leading to hundreds of millions, if not billions, in losses for crypto investors across the globe.
- At spot rates, crypto assets are still reeling from the destabilization.
