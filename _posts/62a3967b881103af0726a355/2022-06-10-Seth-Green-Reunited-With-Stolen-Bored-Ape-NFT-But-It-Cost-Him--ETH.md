The actor has been scrambling to get Bored Ape #8398, who he calls Fred, back in his wallet.

## Highlights

- Seth Green Reunited with Bored Ape NFT… But It Cost him 165 ETH.
- The actor has been scrambling to get the collectible back in his wallet.
- Blockchain records show 165 ETH was transferred to an address that belongs to @DarkWing84.
- The NFT still has a warning label on OpenSea that it's been reported for suspicious activity — a move that effectively stops the collectable from changing hands on its marketplace.
- That's because Fred is about to star as the main character in an NFT-themed TV show.
