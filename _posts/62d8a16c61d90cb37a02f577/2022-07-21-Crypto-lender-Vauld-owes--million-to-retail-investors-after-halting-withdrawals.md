Vauld owes retail investors $363 million out of its total liabilities of $402 million, an affidavit obtained by The Block shows.

## Highlights

- Vauld suspended client withdrawals on July 4 as it fought to stave off insolvency in Singapore.
- The Asian crypto lender abruptly halted client withdrawals this month.
- London-based rival Nexo started a process to potentially acquire Vauld by signing a term sheet that granted a 60-day exclusive exploratory period to conduct due diligence.
- Vauld's total assets are given as $287.7 million in the affidavit, but the affidavit doesn't include "bank balances" That means Vauld has a shortfall of around $70 million, which is estimated to be around $300 million.
- A hearing is scheduled for August 1 and Vauld is seeking an extension for 6 months.
