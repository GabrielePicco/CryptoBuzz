Financial theory demonstrates that the concept is fundamentally flawed

## Highlights

- In the absence of outside funding algorithmic stablecoins cannot be stable, it is impossible to create a successful algorithm.
- The idea was inspired by Vitalik Buterinâ€™s recent thought experiments.
- The proof below is algorithm-free and is thus universal.
- In the event that the stablecoin falls, they must be able to cover the economic losses.
- The system is inherently unstable and requires outside funding from outside world.
- In order for us to make progress in innovation, we must build our foundations on solid ground, our efforts should be made to protect consumers against the outside world, writes CoinDesk.com.com/Bitcoin-Bitcoin-Crypto.
