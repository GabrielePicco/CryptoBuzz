## Highlights

- 2022 saw a bloodbath for the vast majority of crypto assets, after a bull rally through most of 2021 where prices peaked.
- Tesla bought the token in the $30,000-to-$40,000 range at the start of 2022.
- By July, it had sold 75% of its holdings, CEO Musk said in a quarterly earnings call.
