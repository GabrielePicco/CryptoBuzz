The world's largest cryptocurrency has tumbled 63% in 2022, with record outflows reflecting waning confidence in centralized exchanges.

## Highlights

- In November, investors pulled nearly $1.5 billion in bitcoin from crypto exchanges.
- Bitcoin is down roughly 63% in 2022, tumbling from an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021.
- FTX made massive sponsorship deals with sports leagues and star athletes like Tom Brady.
- The collapse of FTX has led to a record amount of bitcoin outflows from cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a report.
- Analysts have likened the FTX fiasco to crypto's Lehman Brothers, and traders have grown more wary over security in centralized exchanges.
- Competitors have turned to so-called proof-of-reserves audits to show customers their money hasn't been loaned out.
