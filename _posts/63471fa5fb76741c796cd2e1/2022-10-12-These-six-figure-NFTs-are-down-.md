Despite previously fetching hundreds of millions of dollars, many NFT collections are now finding it difficult to attract any serious bids.

## Highlights

- Average daily volume of NFT sales has dropped by more than 90% from its peak.
- The most expensive NFT ever sold was CryptoPunk #9998, which sold for a whopping $530 million or 124,457 ETH.
- Some NFT collections like Fidenza and Autoglyphs have retained much of their value.
- Uber-popular artists Beeple and XCOPY are struggling to catch bids anywhere near previous levels.
- One of the most expensive artworks on record was sold at Christieâ€™s auction for $69.3 million in March last year and another was bought for $6.6 million by a museum of crypto art.
