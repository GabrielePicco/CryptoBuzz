DeFi / Crypto - After aggressively farming many of DeFi’s most lucrative opportunities since 2020, SBF is now suggesting his own industry standards, many of which go against the entire concept of decentralisation. Sam says we need “customer protection”. But from who?

## Highlights

- SBF has proposed his own standards for the industry, many of which go against the concept of decentralisation.
- SBF and Alameda have had deep enough.
- pockets (and all the dirty tricks which they wouldn’t get away with in TradFi) to bleed many protocols dry throughout DeFi’s wild west period, and now they want to stifle innovation for the rest of us.
- The idea is that all front-ends would need to become registered broker-dealers with KYC obligations.
- This would mean that, while publishing smart contracts and interacting with them directly would remain unrestricted, any UI or Dapp with a. UI would.
- need to register with US regulators and collect personal info on their US users.
