The accountant of Tether, the $73bn stablecoin, has qualified its accounts, suggesting concerns about its future viability

## Highlights

- The language used by Tether’s accountant in the latest quarterly attestation report suggests it is worried about the future existence of the stablecoin.
- Tether has undergone a sharp contraction since the May 9/10 collapse of the Terra stablecoin, with assets in Tether dropping from $83bn on May 11 to $73bn.
- The stablecoin plays a critical role across the cryptocurrency markets, where it is widely used in trading, as collateral and on cryptocurrency deposit and lending platforms.
- The market price of Tether tokens ($USDT) has since recovered in price to trade close to par value.
- However, Tether still not completely regained its dollar peg and is currently priced at 99.85 cents.
