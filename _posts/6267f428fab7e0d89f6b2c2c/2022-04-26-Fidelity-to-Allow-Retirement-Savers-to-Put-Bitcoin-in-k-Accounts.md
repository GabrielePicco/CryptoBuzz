Fidelity Investments plans to allow investors to put a bitcoin account in their 401(k)s. The endorsement of the nation’s largest retirement-plan provider suggests crypto investing is moving further into the mainstream.

## Highlights

- Fidelity Investments plans to allow investors to put a bitcoin account in their 401(k)s. The endorsement of the nation’s largest retirement-plan provider suggests crypto investing is moving further into the mainstream, but it remains to be seen whether employers will embrace it for their workers.
- The 23,000 companies that use Fidelity to administer their retirement plans will have the option to put bitcoin on the menu later this year, the company said.
- Employees won’t be able to start adding cryptocurrencies to their nest eggs right away, but they’ll be allowed to add them to their 401s at the start of the year.
