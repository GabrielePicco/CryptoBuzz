The number of blockchain developers in the US has declined every year since 2017, leaving some concerned for America's crypto future.

## Highlights

- The number of blockchain developers in the US has declined every year since 2017.
- The U.S.’ share of developers has fallen 2% per year in the last five years, dropping to 29% last year from 40% in 2017.
- Europe maintained a consistent share of around 29% during the five years from 2017 to 2022.
- The drop is “a marginal difference” compared to other regions in the world, a report by Electric Capital said.
- It also points to a globally growing remote crypto ecosystem and workforce in a post-COVID world, Paul Stavropoulos, CEO of credit-focused platform Archie Finance, told TechCrunch+.
