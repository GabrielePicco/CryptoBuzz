Crypto will be classified as high risk in the coming years, but it's here to stay, said the Dutch central bank who chairs the Financial Stability Boards' crypto working group.

## Highlights

- Steven Maijoor is chair of the Financial Stability Boards' crypto working group.
- He said regulators need to set a path for supervising the sector.
- Traditional finance players as well as consumers are interested in getting involved in the sector, he said.
- Despite jurisdictions taking measures to regulate the sector around the world, crypto will remain a high risk for the next few years, he added.
- The FSB's recommendations on global crypto regulation standards will be published in the summer, following the call for industry and expert input on policy recommendations from October, he noted.
- The policy recommendations stem from a principle of "same risk, same regulation," he said.
