Neo-banking challenger Revolut has made crypto a core part of its growth strategy for a number of years.

## Highlights

- Neo-banking challenger Revolut soft-launched crypto'staking' to allow users to earn income on crypto assets.
- Full launch of staking will begin being rolled out this week, AltFi understands.
- Staking is when the holder of a cryptocurrency in a wallet lends their assets, for a certain period of time, to help support the security and operation of a blockchain network.
- In return for their support, the ‘staker’ earns rewards in the form of newly minted tokens or a portion of transaction fees.
- The company now offers trading in almost 100 different crypto tokens and assets as well as having the option of making purchases using crypto balances.
