Months after expressing his belief in Ethereum, Jim Cramer has declared that the cryptocurrency space has \"no real value.\"

## Highlights

- Jim Cramer's comments come months after he said investors could "easily" secure returns of 35 to 40% from investing in the asset class.
- Cramer also previously said in April that he was “a believer” in ETH and that he would continue to add to his holdings.
- The former hedge fund manager also said in June 2021 that he liked ETH because “people use [ETH] to be able to buy things,” revealing that he had bought ETH at around $2,000 at the time of the comments.
- Despite his previous comments, it would appear that Cramer is no longer one of them, writing this article.
