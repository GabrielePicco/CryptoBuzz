Biden's executive order on crypto directs federal agencies to coordinate their efforts in making a plan to regulate the surging industry.

## Highlights

- President Joe Biden's executive order on Wednesday is the first time the White House has weighed in formally on cryptocurrencies.
- Bitcoin jumped 9% on Wednesday afternoon after the executive order was released.
- The order requires agencies to study and plan around cryptocurrency policy in key areas like consumer protection, national security, and illicit finance.
- Some crypto experts say the order is a "watershed moment" for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet, like the Web 3 launch of the Internet.
- But there are some libertarians who take a hardline view of any sort of regulation, including some libertarians.
