Can BTC price avoid a return to weekly losses? Bitcoin toys with multi-week losses.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to two-week lows on June 11 as the weekâ€™s Wall Street trading ended with bears in control.
- BTC/USD reached $28,528 on Bitstamp, its lowest since May 28.
- The pair had fallen in step with stock markets on June 10, these finishing the week noticeably down.
- This was on the back of surprisingly high inflation data from the U.S.
- which took a turn for the worst in stark contrast to expectations.
- The Federal Reserve's FOMC minutes, due for the meeting on June 14-15, will provide clues on how aggressive policymakers plan to be when it comes to stemming price rises.
