ETH managed a sharp rebound after falling to $950. But the token's bearish continuation setup could have it revisit the level again.

## Highlights

- Ether's native token Ether (ETH) fell to as low as $950 on Uniswap this June 13, about 20% lower than its spot rate across other exchanges.
- Over $130M ETH sold in six hours to pay off nearly $73 million worth of debt at Oasis.app, a DeFi lending platform.
- The Oasis borrower continued the selling spree five hours after the first selloff, dumping another stash of nearly 28,000 ETH to pay back another $32 million in debt.
- Veteran trader Peter Brandt's bearish outlook emerged out of a classic continuation pattern, dubbed the "descending triangle," which resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.
