Billionaire investor Mark Cuban believes that while the opportunity for Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) as a smart contract platform may be greater, Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) stil

## Highlights

- Billionaire investor Mark Cuban believes that while the opportunity for Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) as a smart contract platform may be greater, Dogecoin still has more potential applications for the time being.
- Cuban said he does not view market cap as an accurate indicator of a cryptocurrency project's inherent value.
- At press time, Cardano had a market cap of $17.8 billion, while DOGE had $9.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.
- The Shark Tank investor named meme coins Dogecoins and Shiba Inu as examples of coins that have “huge market caps.” Cuban said the next big application that everyone wants to use is built on Cardano.
