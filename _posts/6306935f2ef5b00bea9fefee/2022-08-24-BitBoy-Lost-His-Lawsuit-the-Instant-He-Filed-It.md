Far from quashing or discouraging them, the lawsuit has taken allegations against BitBoy mainstream. Most dramatically, attacks on BitBoy are now spreading on

## Highlights

- Atozy’s original video, posted in November 2021, had a little over 180,000 views at this writing – a respectable but not huge reach.
- But four days ago, the lawsuit was covered by Cr1TiKaL, aka Charles White Jr., a YouTuber with 11.2 million followers and all the mercy of a professional assassin.
- Most dramatically, attacks on BitBoy are now spreading on YouTube far more widely than before the lawsuit.
- Far from quashing or discouraging them, the suit has taken allegations against BitBoy mainstream.
- BitBoy has been accused of using BitBoy to launch a career career of harassment.
