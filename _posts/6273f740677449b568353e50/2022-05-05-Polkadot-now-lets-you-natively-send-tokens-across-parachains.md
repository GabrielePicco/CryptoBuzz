With the launch of XCM, Polkadot has achieved its main offering of interoperability.

## Highlights

- Polkadot has enabled a messaging system called Cross-Consensus Messaging format (XCM) This allows all Polkadots-based blockchains to directly communicate with each other for the first time.
- XCM is not dependent on traditional bridges that rely on the "wrapping" of assets to move them from one blockchain to another.
- Future iterations of the XCM will allow messages to be sent between parachains without needing to be stored on the Relay Chain.
- This setup is considered more secure than bridges alone, which can have centralized weakpoints and have often been hacked for significant amounts of crypto.
- The launch of XCM has achieved its main offering of interoperability.
