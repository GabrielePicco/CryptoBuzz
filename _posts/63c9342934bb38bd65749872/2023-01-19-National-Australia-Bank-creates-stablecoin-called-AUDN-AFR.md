National Australia Bank (NAB) has created a stablecoin called AUDN that will allow its business customers to settle transactions in real-time using Australian dollars on the Ethereum network in mid-year for transactions such as carbon credit trading and remittances.

## Highlights

- National Australia Bank (NAB) is launching a fully backed stablecoin called AUDN.
- The stablecoin will be backed one-to-one with Australian fiat, and the money will be held by the NAB.
- For example, AUDN could be used for carbon credit trading, overseas money transfers and repurchase agreements, NABâ€™s Chief Innovation officer Howard Silby said.
- NAB plans to launch the stablecoin sometime mid-year.
- This is not the first-time banks in Australia have tried to launch a stablecoin product.
- The initiative failed due to competition concerns and the four separate banks being at different stages in their crypto strategies.
