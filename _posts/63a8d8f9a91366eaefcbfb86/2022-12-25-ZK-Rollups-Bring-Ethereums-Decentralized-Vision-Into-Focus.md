Polygon founder Mihailo Bjelic makes the case for zero knowledge technology.

## Highlights

- System 2 has emerged as frontrunners in race to scale the network for mass adoption.
- Systems using zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies are among the most promising – and their potential isn't limited to scaling.
- Polygon founder Mihailo Bjelic makes the case for zero knowledge technology.
- In 2015, the Ethereum protocol proposed a vision for a. decentralized world computer capable of rearchitecting a free and open internet – removed from the whims and constraints of centralized entities – is the focus of this year's Web3 as we know it, says Polygon's Mihilah Bjelchic.
