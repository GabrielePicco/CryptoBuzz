Ethereum Fees Have Risen to 50 cents even with high-demand network, more than one million transactions a day paying. Ethereum yearly inflation rate will be at about -0.5% a year starting this summer.

## Highlights

- Even high-priority transactions now require only 10 gwei per gas unit, with one gwei equaling a billionth of an ETH, equating to around 50 cents in total.
- However, network demand remains high, with over one million transactions each day paying only 50 cents.
- At current levels, Ethereumâ€™s annual inflation rate will be around -0.5% a year starting this summer.
- With the reinstatement of fees to normal levels, 2,500 ETH has been burned in the last 24 hours.
- If ETH was fully Proof of Stake, 1,000 ETH would be taken out of the supply every day, as the daily staking incentive is around 1,400 eth.
