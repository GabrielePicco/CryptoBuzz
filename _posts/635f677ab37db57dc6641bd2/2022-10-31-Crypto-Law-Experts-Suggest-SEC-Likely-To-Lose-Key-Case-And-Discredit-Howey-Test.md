Ripple is ready to settle and pay fine if SEC declares XRP a currency, says company lawyer. Agency credibility, Gensler reputation at stake.

## Highlights

- The verdict could drastically limit the SECâ€™s authority to regulate crypto in the U.S.
- The SEC filed its bombshell lawsuit against Ripple and its two senior executives in December 2020, on the last day in office for ex-chairman Jay Clayton.
- Ripple's stellar defense team for Ripple went for the jugular, calling out the bizarre SEC premise that XRP had been an unregistered investment contract in Ripple since 2013 and that even sales of billions of XRP tokens on the secondary market for seven years were securities as well.
- Retail XRP holders launched themselves into the case by the tens of thousands.
- Ripple also focused on a market-moving speech in 2018 by the SEC's Director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman.
