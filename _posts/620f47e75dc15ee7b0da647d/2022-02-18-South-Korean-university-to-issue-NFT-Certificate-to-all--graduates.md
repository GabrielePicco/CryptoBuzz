South Korea’s Hoseo University will issue non-fungible token (NFT) degrees and certificates to all 2,830 graduates of its 2021 batch at its graduation

## Highlights

- South Korea’s Hoseo University will issue non-fungible token (NFT) degrees and certificates to all 2,830 graduates of its 2021 batch at its graduation ceremony on Friday.
- The university hopes the pivot from a paper-based degree to NFTs will improve access to administrative services and prevent forgery or alteration of the degree.
- A wide range of industries and entities in South Korea have started to adopt NFTS, with Samsung, SK and LG including Nfts in their newest line of goods and services.
- Earlier this week, South Korea's Samsung-backed Sungkyunkwan University issued NFT certificates to three students.
