Ahead of its zkEVM upgrade, Polygon sees its MATIC token value continue to ruse, netting one whale a massive profit.

## Highlights

- MATIC is up 19% in the past week to $1.19, lifting gains for Polygon's native token to upwards of 50% in January.
- Polygon is a sidechain that runs in tandem with Ethereum and seeks to improve on its counterpart by offering faster transactions and lower fees.
- At its highest price, the 4 million in MATIC bought in 2020 would’ve been worth $11.7 million.
- The token remains nearly 60% down from its all-time high of $2.92 in December 2021.
- MATIC’s price action comes as Polygon prepares to follow through on an upgrade that was first announced in July last year.
