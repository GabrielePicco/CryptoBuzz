A decades-old law was used to sentence an OTC Bitcoin trader to prison. Rizzn says more clarity around Bitcoin and blockchain law is needed.

## Highlights

- Mark Alexander Hopkins, also known as Doctor Bitcoin, was sentenced to prison last week.
- He says he acted as an OTC Bitcoin trader, but he didn't commit any fraud.
- The US Department of Justice says his actions enabled a scammer who committed fraud with funds Hopkins transacted on her behalf.
- Hopkins calls for more clarity around financial laws that govern the blockchain, and we've got to agree.
- After all, one NFT marketplace admitted as many as 80 percent of its transactions are spam or fraud in January this year.
- On one hand, it does seem like most people exchanging cash for crypto funds while ignoring rules around documentation probably have a sense that many of their customers are not aboveboard.
