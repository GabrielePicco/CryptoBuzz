DeFi crypto Solana has struggled in 2022, between outages and exposure to FTX, but will 2023 hold more of the same, or be a boon for the Ethereum competitor?

## Highlights

- Solana was touted as the cryptocurrency that would challenge ether with an eco-friendlier approach.
- Investors who made that bet had a miserable year.
- The token's market cap collapsed from over $55 billion in January to barely above $3 billion at year-end.
- Solana's biggest problems in late 2022 was its close relationship to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces eight criminal fraud charges after his crypto exchange went bankrupt last month.
- In the last week, Solana has declined over 30% in just one hour of trading on Thursday, bringing it to the lowest since early 2021, around the time the disgraced former crypto billionaire began to vocally offer his support for the project.
