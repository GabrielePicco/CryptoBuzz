Investors are careful about which crypto exchange to use, which led to some interesting observations in terms of Binance and Coinbase.

## Highlights

- Blockware Solutionâ€™s lead insights analyst Will Clemente posted on July 18 a Glassnode chart that compares and contrasts the change in Bitcoin (BTC) balances on Binance and Coinbase exchanges over time.
- Up until recent days, the older exchange of the two (founded in 2012), was in a convincing lead, but the situation has flipped in favor of Binance, which joined the crypto market in 2017.
- There are many potential reasons why the situation with Binance holding more Bitcoin has changed and why people are finding the exchange a more favorable place for selling and exchanging their crypto for fiat or other assets.
- Binance's American affiliate, Binance.US, launched zero-fee trading in late June for 13 Bitcoin spot trading pairs.
