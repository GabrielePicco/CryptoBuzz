Crypto fund Pantera Capital says that the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving event will spark a bull rally beginning in early 2024.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price has rallied before and after the halving events in the past.
- Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead says the price of Bitcoin is likely to bottom throughout November and pick up steam ahead of the next halving.
- The next event is when minersâ€™ block rewards are cut in half and, as a result, the supply of new Bitcoins is crunched.
- At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading hands at $16,887; the next one is expected to occur on March 22, 2024.
- The Daily Hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets, nor is an investment advisor.
