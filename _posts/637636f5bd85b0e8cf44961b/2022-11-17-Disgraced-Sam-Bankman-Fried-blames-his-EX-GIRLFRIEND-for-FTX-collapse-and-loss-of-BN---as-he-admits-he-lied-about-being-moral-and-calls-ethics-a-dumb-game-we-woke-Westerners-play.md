Sam Bankman-Fried, 30, blamed his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison for the collapse of his company. Ellison is the owner of the company Alameda - who the FTX owner said lost his company's money.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried, 30, is still in the Bahamas following his company's $32 billion loss.
- He openly spoke with Vox reporter Kelsey Piper through Twitter's direct message feature on Tuesday about his current circumstances with little remorse.
- The FTX owner told Piper that his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison's company Alameda was responsible for gambling and losing the company's money - to which he was 'oblivious' until it was too late.
- He also walked back his previous comments about the importance of ethics within the crypto world and called it a 'front' Authorities in America and the Bahamas are discussing the possibility of extraditing him to the United States for questioning.
