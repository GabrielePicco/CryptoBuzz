Djed, a decentralized stablecoin designed to track the US dollar, launched on the Cardano blockchain after being in development for over a year.

## Highlights

- Djed was developed by blockchain firm Coti in collaboration with Cardano's core developer Input Output.
- It aims to be used on DeFi protocols in the Cardano ecosystem as a stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies.
- Each stablecoin will be over-collateralized by 400-800% with ADA â€” while using SHEN as a reserve coin.
- Djed is expected to be integrated into 40 apps within the cardano ecosystem.
- In November, the Coti team told The Block it had plans to launch DjedPay, a service that will let merchants and other crypto players accept payments in the stablecoin.
- It already received support from decentralized exchanges MinSwap, Wingriders and Muesli
