It's not all doom and gloom.

## Highlights

- In the first half of the year, VCs bet $17.5 billion on digital currency and blockchain startups.
- That puts investment on course to top the record $26.9 billion raised last year.
- A double whammy of macro economic headwinds and blow-ups at major projects this year have seen bitcoin plummet about 65% from its November record of $69,000.
- Some VCs are shrugging off the gloom, with many deploying substantial war chests as their faith in the underlying tech behind crypto coins remains strong.
- North America, long the hotspot for VC deals, has again been the focus of activity with about $11.4 billion in the six months to June.
