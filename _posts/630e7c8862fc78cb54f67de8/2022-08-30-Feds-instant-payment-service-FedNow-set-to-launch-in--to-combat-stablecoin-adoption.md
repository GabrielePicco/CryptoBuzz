The Federal Reserve is on track to launch an instant payment service called FedNow between May and July of 2023, allowing settlement of U.S. payments in seconds and potentially negating the need for the creation of a central bank digital currency.

## Highlights

- Federal Reserve is on track to deliver an instant payment service called FedNow between May and July 2023.
- FedNow will enable consumers and businesses to send payments instantly.
- The FedNow service also potentially negates the need for the creation of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC.
- Fed has been testing the system with a limited number of banks and institutions, but Brainard called on financial institutions, service providers, and software companies to adopt the FedNow Service now to ensure the system will work smoothly come next spring, he said in a speech on Monday.
- Officials are thinking through what needs a CBDC would fulfill after the release of FedNow system.
