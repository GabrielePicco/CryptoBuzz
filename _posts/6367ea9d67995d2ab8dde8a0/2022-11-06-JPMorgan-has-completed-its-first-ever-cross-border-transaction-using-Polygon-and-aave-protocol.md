It’s a bit surprising to see JP Morgan at the forefront of this trend given how critical the bank’s CEO has been of the cryptocurrency space.

## Highlights

- JPMorgan completed its first live cross-border transaction on a public blockchain using the ethereum layer-two network Polygon MATIC.
- JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon is an outspoken critic of bitcoin and crypto.
- The bank's interest in crypto, blockchain and DeFi is somewhat at odds with the bank's chief executive who called crypto a "decentralized Ponzi scheme" in September.
- The bitcoin price has crashed over the last year but is still far higher than it was at the beginning of its late 2020 price boom, pushing ethereum, other cryptocurrencies and so-called DeFi technololgy to the fore.
