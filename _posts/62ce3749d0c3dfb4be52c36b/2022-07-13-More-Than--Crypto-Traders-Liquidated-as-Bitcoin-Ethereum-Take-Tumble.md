Leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped several points this morning, after falling below $20,000 and edging towards $1,000, respectively

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) shed 3.72% over the past 24 hours, with the leading cryptocurrency dropping to levels as low as $19,621.
- The market capitalization of the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has crashed from a whopping $1.27 trillion in November 2021 to under $377 billion today.
- More than 62,000 traders were liquidated in the crypto market, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
- The primary drivers behind the bearish action are the plummeting crypto trading volumes, miner selling pressure, and high expectation of another rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
- The Fed is again meeting on July 26, with many expecting another 75-basis point hike.
