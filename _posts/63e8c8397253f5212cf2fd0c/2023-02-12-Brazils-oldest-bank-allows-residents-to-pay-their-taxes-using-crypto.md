Banco do Brasil is offering Brazilian taxpayers the ability to pay their tax bills using cryptocurrency.

## Highlights

- Banco do Brasil is offering Brazilian taxpayers the ability to pay their tax bills using cryptocurrency.
- The move comes after the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro started accepting cryptocurrencies as payments for taxes in October 2022.
- Only investors who trade more than 35,000 reals (around $6,711) in crypto should pay income tax.
- Brazil’s citizens were previously told, in May 2022, that they would be required to pay taxes on like-kind crypto trades, for example, swapping Bitcoin (BTC) for Ether (ETH) However, not all crypto investors in Brazil need to declare their trades, but not all must pay taxes.
