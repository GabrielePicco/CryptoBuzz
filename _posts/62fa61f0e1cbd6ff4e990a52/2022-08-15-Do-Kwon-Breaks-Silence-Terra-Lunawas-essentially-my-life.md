Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon gives first interview to Coinage, discussing Terra failure, and Blockworks has an early look

## Highlights

- Do Kwon faces allegations of fraud in South Korea, among other potential legal jeopardy.
- “I’ve never thought about what could happen to me if this fails,” Kwon said in an interview with Coinage.
- Terra creator said there was likely an insider at Terraform Labs who took advantage of information on the protocol’s vulnerabilities to profit.
- Kwon, who moved to Singapore prior to the Terra crash, said he did so out of fear for the safety of his wife and child.
- He said that Terra was not a Ponzi scheme, as the earliest investors were among the hardest hit by the crash.
