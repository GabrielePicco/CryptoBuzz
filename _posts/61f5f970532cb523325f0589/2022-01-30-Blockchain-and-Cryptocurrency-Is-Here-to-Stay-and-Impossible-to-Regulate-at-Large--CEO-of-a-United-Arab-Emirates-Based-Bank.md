According to the chief executive officer of the Bank of Sharjah, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are difficult to regulate.

## Highlights

- Bank of Sharjah CEO Varouj Nerguizian said cryptocurrencies are not going away but are likely to become a significant part of the banking system.
- He said banks can only benefit from technology when they deploy non-public or enterprise blockchains.
- The CEO also explained how the technology can potentially be a double-edged sword to financial institutions that are attempting to adapt to the post-pandemic landscape.
- Despite this prediction, the CEO admits that many in the banking industry still do not fully understand this technology.
- However, in UAE, jurisdictions like Abu Dhabi Global Market [ADGM] and Dubai International Financial Centre [DIFC] have come up with crypto regulations.
