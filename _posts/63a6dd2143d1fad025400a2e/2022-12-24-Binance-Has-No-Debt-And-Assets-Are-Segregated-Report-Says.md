Binance has been under intense scrutiny since it released its proof of reserves about a month ago. The crypto exchange had done so in a bid to assure users

## Highlights

- Binance has been under intense scrutiny since it released its proof of reserves about a month ago.
- The crypto exchange had done so in a bid to assure users that all deposited funds were safe and that it was not going to collapse like FTX.
- As the FUD ramped up, more than $6 billion was withdrawn from the exchange in a matter of days.
- Binance says it does not mix user funds with company funds and has enough capital reserves to cover daily operations.
- It makes its profit from transaction fees on its platform, as well as returns on investments made through its investment and acquisitions arm Binance Labs.
- The company has $7.5 billion in total assets under management and has recorded immense returns on investment of 2,100% from the over 200 projects
