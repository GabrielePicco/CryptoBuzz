Bitcoin's price soared to $42,000 on a reported leaked press release of President Biden's executive order on crypto.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price jumped past $41K on a leaked press release containing information on President Bidenâ€™s expected administrative order on crypto.
- The Treasury Department's statement has since been removed, and a spokesperson declined to comment for Bloomberg.
- The leaked document read that the Treasury will be partnering with other agencies to compile a report on the future of payment systems and money, in general.
- The text was perceived well by the market and Bitcoin's value soared from slightly below $39,000 to just shy of $42,000.
- The entire action also left around $190 million worth of liquidated positions in the past 24 hours, the majority of which are naturally short.
