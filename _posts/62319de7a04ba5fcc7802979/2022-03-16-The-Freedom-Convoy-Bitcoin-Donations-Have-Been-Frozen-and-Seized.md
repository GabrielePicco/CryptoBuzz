Bitcoin was supposed to be a financial lifeline for vaccine mandate protesters in Canada. That hasn't exactly worked out to plan.

## Highlights

- A Canadian anti-vaccine protest in the city of Ottawa saw millions of dollars in Bitcoin donated to the self-styled "freedom convoy" Organizers distribute Bitcoin to truckers who can't cash out their donations.
- Many of the funds are now being seized from the organizers.
- The organizers are now facing a class-action lawsuit that wants to give all the donated bitcoins to Ottawa citizens who were in the vicinity of the protests.
- Bitcoin is a system of public ledger, so all transactions on the network are visible to everyone.
- This includes, of course, the authorities that want to track down the drivers of the truckers so they can't access the funds.
