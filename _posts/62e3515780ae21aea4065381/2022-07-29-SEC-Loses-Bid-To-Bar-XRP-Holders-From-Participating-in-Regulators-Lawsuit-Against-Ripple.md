U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres is allowing XRP holders to remain a part of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ongoing legal battle with Ripple.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- District Judge Analisa Torres allows XRP holders to retain their status as ‘amici curiae’ in the SEC’s action against Ripple Labs Inc.
- The SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple in late December 2020, declaring XRP a security and accusing the San Francisco payments company of selling the crypto asset without proper authorization.
- Judge Torres denies XRP Holders the opportunity to assist in evaluating the qualifications of an SEC expert, but she will allow XRP holder to file an application to brief their concerns regarding the SEC's expert.
- The move was a direct response to the SEC wanting to bring in an expert to testify on what XRP owners thought when they purchased the sixth-largest crypto asset.
