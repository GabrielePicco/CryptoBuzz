FTX told by Binance to sweeten the deal and throw in FTX.US, according to text conversations reviewed by Blockworks. But will that fly?

## Highlights

- Binance will not go ahead with proposed deal to acquire FTX unless US-based exchange partner FTX.US is part of the deal.
- Source: Federal Trade Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have opened investigations into FTX this morning.
- Legal advisors to the deal are concerned that US regulators would block any sale of a US entity to Binance.
- Binance released a statement shortly after publication of this story: “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX”
