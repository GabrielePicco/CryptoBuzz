Our reader’s bank did not refund or help despite her vulnerable state

## Highlights

- Katie, 50, lost her brother to brain cancer in 2019 and then her husband to the same cruel disease in 2020.
- She started to rebuild her life and joined a dating site to find happiness again.
- She agreed to an initial £2,000 investment and invested a further £51,000.
- But she realised she had been scammed when her 'boyfriend' didn't come home.
- Nationwide said there was no evidence you had fallen for a scam because you had transferred money into a crypto­currency account held in your name.
- The Financial Ombudsman for a second opinion found in your favour and asked you to pay you £53,500.
