## Highlights

- Taxpayer James Harper can take the Internal Revenue Service to federal court for gathering private financial information about his use of virtual currency from third-party exchanges without a lawful subpoena.
- IRS sought to deny that right, arguing that allowing people to object to its collecting personal data would unduly hamper tax-collection efforts.
- NCLA released the following statements: “Every citizen claiming the government is violating his constitutional rights is entitled to his day in court.
- The court rightly rejected that argument.
- Efficient tax collection must never be permitted to trump constitutional rights” NCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group founded by prominent legal scholar Philip Hamburger.
