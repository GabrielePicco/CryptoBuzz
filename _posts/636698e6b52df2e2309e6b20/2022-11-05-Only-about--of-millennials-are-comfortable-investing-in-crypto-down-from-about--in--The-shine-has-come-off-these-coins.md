Millennials are significantly less comfortable with cryptocurrency investing than they were a year ago, according to a new Bankrate survey.

## Highlights

- Only about 21% of Americans feel comfortable investing in cryptocurrency in 2022, according to a new Bankrate survey.
- Nearly $2 trillion has been wiped off the entire crypto market since November 2021.
- Bitcoin has been trading between $18,000 and $25,000 since June down from its record highs of over $65,000 in November 2021.
- For this reason, experts typically advise against investing more money into cryptocurrency than you're willing to potentially lose, since there's no guarantee of earning a profit.
- Buying an S&P 500 index fund regularly and then holding on through thick and thin has built the fortunes of many American millionaires, Bankrate's James Royal says.
