September’s CPI release comes in hot and sparks one of the most volatile days we’ve seen yet. The BM Pro team’s thoughts on where a bitcoin low price could be.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter, looks at where a bitcoin low price could be.
- Core CPI came in hotter than expected at 6.6% year-over-year and 0.4% month-over month.
- The bull case is that we’ve found a durable bottom at $18,000 and we won’t see the max drawdown reach beyond 73%.
- In a strong downward move, $10,000 is a place where many in the market have their spot cost basis and could start feeling some real drawdown pain or lack of conviction in a bear market.
- If we are going to see a max cycle drawdown come in less than the last two cycles — let’s say around 80% — then we're looking at a price around $13,500.
