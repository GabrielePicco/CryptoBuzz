The BIS found that retail investors bought the dip amid the bloodbath while the broader financial system remained generally unharmed.

## Highlights

- A recent report by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) revealed that the crypto industry lost over $650 billion after two major scandals that rocked the market last year.
- The report titled “Crypto Shocks and Retail Losses” explained investors’ trading behavior during and after the scandals, their profits and losses, and the effects of the crypto market turmoil in the broader financial system.
- While individual and institutional investors recorded huge losses in their crypto investments, the traditional financial system remained unscathed.
- The BIS found that retail investors bought the dip amid the bloodbath while other investors increased their bitcoin positions by buying the dip.
