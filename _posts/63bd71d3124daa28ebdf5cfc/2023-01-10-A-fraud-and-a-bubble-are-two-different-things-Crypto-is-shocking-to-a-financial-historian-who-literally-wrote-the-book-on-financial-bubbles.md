Financial historian William Quinn says crypto is either the smartest “Ponzi” or the stupidest “bubble” in history: “And the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.”

## Highlights

- William Quinn, a senior lecturer at Queens’ University Belfast, says the crypto space has lost more than $2 trillion in value over the past year.
- He believes the cryptocurrency fervor of the past decade is either a “stupider bubble than any previous bubble” in financial history, or “a smarter Ponzi than any other Ponzis’ — or a third option.
- Quinn argues that cryptocurrencies have three defining features that make them unique from past financial bubbles.
- He argued that the real question could be whether to classify crypto as a "fraud" or a "bubble" or "a fraud" But some of Wall Street’s most respected investors have become crypto bulls.
