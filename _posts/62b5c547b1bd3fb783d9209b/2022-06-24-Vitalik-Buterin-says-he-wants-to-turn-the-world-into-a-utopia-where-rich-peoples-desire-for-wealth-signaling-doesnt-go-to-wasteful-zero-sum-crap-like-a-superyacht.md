Calling crypto “a frontier social movement,” Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wants his community to think beyond expensive baubles and “repeating unimaginative 20th century crap except with ourselves at the top.”

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin wants to make society more like the Yudkowskian dath ilan utopia.
- In this “utopia,” he said, “instead of rich people’s desire for wealth signaling going into wasteful zero sum crap, it goes into supporting public goods” He also said there are more honorable ways to burn $50 million to impress people than buying a superyacht.
- In the past, he has shared similar hopes for the space, urging that crypto be used for social causes rather than speculative financial bets.
- In a recent interview, he told Fortune that he had misinterpreted a vision for soulbound tokens, which he said had been misinterpreted.
