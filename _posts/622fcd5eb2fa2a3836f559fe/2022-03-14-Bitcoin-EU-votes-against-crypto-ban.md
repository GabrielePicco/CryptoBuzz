The European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee voted against a proof-of-work ban.

## Highlights

- The European Union moved to vote against a crypto ban after a plan to regulate the industry failed to receive the votes required.
- The proposal could have forced PoW cryptocurrencies to move to more environmentally friendly mining.
- The controversial plan had previously sparked negative reactions from the crypto industry and community.
- But analysts say the risks are "dominant" in the short term as ethereum plans to switch from PoW to PoS, but bitcoin is unable to make this transition.
- An earlier outline didn’t mention a PoW protocol concept, EU parliamentarian and crypto-expert Stefan Berger of Germany’s Christian Democratic Party said in a Tweet last week.
