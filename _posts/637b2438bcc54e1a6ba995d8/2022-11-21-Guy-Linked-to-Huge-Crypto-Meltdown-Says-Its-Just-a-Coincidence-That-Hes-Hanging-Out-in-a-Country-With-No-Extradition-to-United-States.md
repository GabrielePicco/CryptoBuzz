As crypto exchange FTX continues its demise, 3AC's Zhu Su and Kyle Davies have somewhat unexpectedly crawled out of the rubble.

## Highlights

- Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, the now-maybe-not-missing 3AC cofounders of the notorious Three Arrows Capital (3AC) hedge fund, have returned to the public.
- The two have taken to Twitter in a firestorm, explaining in long, winding threads how their own firm's demise wasn't their fault.
- They've apologized for misreading Luna-Terra's stability, but their position is clear: "FTX [and] Alameda colluded to trade against clients," Davies told CNBC in a Wednesday interview.
- The pair abandoned their Singapore offices during the summer's industry meltdown, which their firm's implosion was closely tied to.
