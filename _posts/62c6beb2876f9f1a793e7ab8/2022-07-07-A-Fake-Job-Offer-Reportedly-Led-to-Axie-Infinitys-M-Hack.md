Lazarus, a hacker group associated with North Korea, is thought to be behind the hack.

## Highlights

- Play to Earn game Axie Infinity was hacked in March to steal $620 million worth of crypto.
- The Pokemon-inspired game was generating over $15 million in revenue each day.
- The US government said Lazarus, a North Korea-backed outfit, was behind the heist.
- The hack was socially engineered by "recruiters" on LinkedIn who sent a fake job offer to a senior Sky Mavis engineer.
- The spyware encased in the PDF allowed the hacker to control four of Ronin's nine validators.
- After ether's price drop, the total steal is now worth $229 million, and the developer is reimbursing players.
