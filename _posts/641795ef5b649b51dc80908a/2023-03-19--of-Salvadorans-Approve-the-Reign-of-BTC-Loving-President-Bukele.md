The bitcoin supporter - President Nayib Bukele - supposedly enjoys a solid approval rate of 91%.

## Highlights

- A survey conducted by La Prensa Grafica found that President Nayib Bukele has the support of 91% of the locals.
- Less than 7% disapproved, while 2.1% did not respond to the question.
- The people most satisfied with the President's administration are mainly younger generations and individuals with middle economic status.
- The 41-year-old leader is known as a keen proponent of bitcoin, with the local government launching numerous initiatives focused on the primary cryptocurrency lately.
- The most eminent example was the adoption of BTC as a legal tender inside El Salvadorâ€™s borders in September 2021.
- However, many Salvadorans seem to be against the strategy, describing it as one of the biggest failures of the cabinet.
