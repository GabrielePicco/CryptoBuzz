The Federal Reserve is not trying to engineer a recession to stop inflation but is fully committed to bringing prices under control even if doing so risks an economic downturn, U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Fed chief Jerome Powell says the central bank is not trying to engineer a recession to stop inflation.
- Powell: "It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all" The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest hike since 1994 - to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%.
- Inflation continues to run at least three times higher than the Fed's targeted level of 2%.
- The Fed in coming months will be looking for "compelling evidence" of slowing price pressures before it eases up on the interest rate increases it kicked off.
