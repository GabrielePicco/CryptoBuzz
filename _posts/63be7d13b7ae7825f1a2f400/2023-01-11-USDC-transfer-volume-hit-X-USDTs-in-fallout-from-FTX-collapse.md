USDC has seen its transfer volumes surge following the fallout of FTX, often recording daily volumes over 5x that of its leading competitor USDT.

## Highlights

- Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) has grown in popularity since the collapse of FTX.
- USDC now frequently reaches daily transfer volumes four to five times that recorded by competitor Tether (USDT) USDC is regarded by some in the crypto community as a potentially safer option.
- Tether was fined $41 million in October 2021 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which accused it of only holding sufficient reserves 27.6% of the time between 2016 and 2018 despite claiming its tokens were fully backed by fiat currencies.
- Despite the market cap of USDT being $23 billion greater than USDC, the difference was in USDCâ€™s favor by a margin of four and a half times.
