The revelation comes as founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Zixiao “Gary” Wang, engineer Nishad Singh and ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison face a hearing.

## Highlights

- FTX Australia administrators KordaMentha said last month that there was $42 million in bank accounts linked to the local FTX operations.
- It is estimated that 1 million customers face loses.
- The main FTX business may have also transferred as much as $US10 billion of customer money out of its exchange and into Alameda Research.
- The news that the leaders of the company had a chat group called “Wirefraud” heightens concerns about the prospect of wrongdoing by Mr Bankman-Fried and his colleagues.
- The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are investigating FTX.
- It has been just over one month since FTX filed for US bankruptcy court protection.
