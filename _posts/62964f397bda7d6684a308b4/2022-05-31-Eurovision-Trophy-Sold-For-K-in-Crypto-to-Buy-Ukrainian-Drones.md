\"We appreciate each and every one of you who donated to this auction,\" the winners wrote on Facebook.

## Highlights

- The Fed will let bonds mature off its $9 trillion balance sheet without replacement starting June 1.
- The Fed's so-called quantitative tightening (QT) could also send yields higher, though analysts say this will depend on the direction of the economy.
- The key metric to watch will be whether Treasury volatility picks up as a result in a market already suffering bouts of low liquidity, analysts say.
- The Federal Reserve is trying to normalize policy and bring down soaring inflation by normalizing the economy and bringing down the rate of interest rates and inflation.
- The winners of the auction will be announced on June 1 at auction on behalf of the winners of this auction on Facebook.
