The Winklevoss Twins hold a stake in 50 blockchain and crypto companies, according to a portfolio posted online.

## Highlights

- The Winklevoss Twins have invested in 50 cryptocurrency and blockchain companies, according to their crypto portfolio posted online.
- Their stakes are invested through their family office and the investment arm of Gemini, a regulated cryptocurrency exchange that they own.
- Their continuous investment in crypto is a continuation of their strong belief in crypto, a conviction they have had in the industry since they bought roughly one percent of the total Bitcoin supply in 2012.
- However, the recent dip in the cryptocurrency market could test their resilience.
- The collapse of LUNA and the algorithmic stablecoin, UST, have sent negative reverberations across the cryptocurrency markets, causing jitters.
- The contraction in the crypto market could also impact crypto funding in the U.S.
