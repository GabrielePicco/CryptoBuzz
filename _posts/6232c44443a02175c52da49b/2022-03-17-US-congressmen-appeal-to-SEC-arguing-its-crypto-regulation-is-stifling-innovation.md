Eight US congressmen have written to the SEC regarding the agency’s information-seeking process where crypto startups are concerned.

## Highlights

- Eight US congressmen have written to the SEC regarding the agency’s information-seeking process where crypto startups are concerned.
- Representatives Tom Emmer, Darren Soto, Warren Davidson, Jake Auchincloss, Byron Donalds, Josh Gottheimer, Ted Budd, and Ritchie Torres are all signatories of the bipartisan letter sent on March 16.
- The congressmen posed a series of questions to “understand how and why the SEC is soliciting information from private firms related to cryptocurrency and blockchain.” The SEC has made numerous headlines over the past couple of months due to its ongoing litigation against Ripple Labs Inc, a blockchain payment company that is accused of selling more than $1.3 billion in unregistered XRP tokens.
