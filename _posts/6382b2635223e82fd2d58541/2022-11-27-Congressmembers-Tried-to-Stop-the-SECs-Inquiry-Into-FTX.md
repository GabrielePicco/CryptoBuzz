The ‘Blockchain Eight’ wrote a bipartisan letter in March attempting to chill the SEC’s information requests to crypto firms. FTX was one of those firms.

## Highlights

- The Prospect confirms that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information from collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
- Eight members of the “Blockchain Eight’s” wrote a letter asking the SEC to make informal inquiries to the company.
- FTX was one of those firms receiving information requests from the SEC, about the very activities that have brought down the firm.
- Five of the eight members received campaign donations from FTX employees, ranging from $2,900 to $11,600, from a Super PAC created by FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame.
- The money helped House Republicans win the majority in 2022, though FTX has been portrayed as a Democratic firm.
