The Central African Republic heralded its status as the only country in Africa to adopt Bitcoin as legal currency, but 8 months later, many questions remain about what's really going on.

## Highlights

- The Central African Republic became the first country in Africa to adopt Bitcoin as legal currency.
- It would take the average CAR citizen 60 years to buy a single coin in 60 years.
- The CFA franc was created in 1945 to be the currency of the “French Colonies of Africa,” and with France controlling printing and circulation, the French government effectively still has financial control over almost one million square miles of African land and more than 180 million people.
- Some of the African nations have fought against the currency, with riots taking place across the continent, involving citizens smashing up France-linked shops and denouncing the French language being taught in schools.
- In CAR only 14 percent of the population have access to electricity.
