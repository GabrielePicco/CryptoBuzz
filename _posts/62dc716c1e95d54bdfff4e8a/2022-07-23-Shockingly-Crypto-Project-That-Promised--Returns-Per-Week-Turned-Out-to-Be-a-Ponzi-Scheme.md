According to a new report, cryptocurrency company EminiFX collected a quarter of a billion dollars from investors before being exposed as a Ponzi scheme.

## Highlights

- A preliminary report says EminiFX collected $250 million from around 62,000 users between September 2021 and May 2022.
- In May, the Justice Department and Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused the company of being a Ponzi scheme.
- Many of the victims are from Haiti, and many are standing behind the founder, Eddy Alexandre, who was born there.
- A petition on Change.org has already been signed by almost 14,000 EmineFX investors.
- It's a devastating story that appears to illustrate an age-old lesson: if it sounds too good to be true, it's probably a scam, especially in the chaotic world of crypto.
