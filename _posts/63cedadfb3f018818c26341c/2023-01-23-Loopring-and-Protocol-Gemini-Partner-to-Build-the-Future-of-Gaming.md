We’re thrilled to announce our partnership with Protocol: Gemini ​​to bring their immersive Web3 games to Ethereum L2. Loopring is a secure compression machine that hyper-scales Ethereum applications…

## Highlights

- Loopring and Protocol: Gemini partner to bring immersive Web3 games to the world of gaming.
- Loopring is a secure compression machine that hyper-scales Ethereum applications reducing costs per transaction to as little as 1/100th of Layer 1.
- One of the games they are building, in collaboration with PuzzleGang, is ATTLG 2.0, a puzzle-heavy and interactive experience designed to challenge players’ problem-solving skills.
- The decision to build on Loopring was easy because it has ETH-level security at a fraction of the cost, while having blazing fast transaction speeds; all the while providing a seamless experience to the users.
