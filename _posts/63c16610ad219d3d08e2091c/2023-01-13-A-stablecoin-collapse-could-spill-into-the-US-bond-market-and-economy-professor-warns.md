While there are no signs of major stablecoins collapsing, an economics professor at Cornell University says it's something regulators are worried about.

## Highlights

- A run on a stablecoin would mean large swathes of users looking to redeem their digital currency for fiat.
- That could mean large amounts of U.S.
- Treasurys being sold off.
- Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, says it's something regulators are worried about.
- There are no signs of major stablecoins collapsing, but regulators are concerned about the impact it could have on traditional financial markets like stocks and the real economy.
- The near $1.4 trillion collapse of the crypto market in 2022 didn't make a dent to traditional assets like stocks or to the real world's economy, he says.
