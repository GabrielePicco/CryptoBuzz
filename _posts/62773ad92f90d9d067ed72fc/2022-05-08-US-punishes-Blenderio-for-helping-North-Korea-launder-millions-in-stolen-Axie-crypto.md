Blender.io, a cryptocurrency mixer, has been sanctioned by the US government for allegedly laundering stolen funds tied to the North Korean government.

## Highlights

- US Treasury Department says Blender.io was used to launder $20.5 million worth of stolen cryptocurrency from Axie Infinity hack.
- This is the first time it's ever levied sanctions against a Bitcoin mixer.
- Now that it's sanctioned, it won't be able to access any of its funds that were stored in the US, nor can it do transactions with U.S.
- companies or citizens.
- The move is essentially cutting the Bitcoin mixer off from the US financial system, but it's not the first of its kind.
- The Treasury also alleges that Blender laundered money for ransomware organizations like Conti, Trickbot, and Sodinokibi.
