BONK is still massively outperforming other coins this week, fueling Solana’s own price surge despite the meme coin’s volatility.

## Highlights

- Meme coins and tokens are famously volatile, surging and falling based on social media sentiment.
- Now BONK, a Solana-based, dog-themed token, is experiencing that same kind of turbulent momentum.
- On Wednesday and into early Thursday, the token more than tripled in price, peaking at $0.00000487.
- On Thursday, it fell by 54% in less than 11 hours, but is already rebounding.
- The token is up more than 3,300% over the last week, and still retains a 42% gain over the past 24 hours.
- The biggest beneficiaries are developers and creators that are building on Solana, as well as collectors of popular NFT projects.
