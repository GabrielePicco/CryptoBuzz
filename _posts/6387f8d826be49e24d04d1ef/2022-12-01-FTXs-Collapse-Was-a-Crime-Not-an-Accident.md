Sam Bankman-Fried is a con man and fraudster of historic proportions. But you might not learn that from the New York Times, CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris writes.

## Highlights

- FTX had been funneling customer assets to Alameda for use in trading, lending and investing activities.
- Reuters made the stunning report that as much as $10 billion in user funds had been sent from FTX.
- At the time, it was believed that as little as $2 billion of those funds had disappeared.
- Now the losses appear to have been much higher.
- Sam Bankman-Fried is a con man and fraudster of historic proportions, CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris writes.
