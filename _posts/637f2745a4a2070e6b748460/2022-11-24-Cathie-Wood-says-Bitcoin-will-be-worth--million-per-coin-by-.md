\"Sometimes you need to battle test, you need to go through crises... to see the survivors,\" Wood told Bloomberg.

## Highlights

- Cathie Wood reiterated her forecast for bitcoin to hit $1 million by 2030 in a Bloomberg interview Tuesday.
- She believes the underlying technology of the blockchain will give bitcoin staying power.
- Wood views the so-called crypto winter as an opportunity to put the token's infrastructure and investment thesis to the test.
- On Wednesday, it rose 2% to $16,488.
- "We think bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose," she maintained.
- The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin, has shed 64% of its value this year, but Wood remains bullish not only on the tokens and crypto more broadly.
