Clawback provisions could force business and investors to return billions of dollars paid by FTX.

## Highlights

- FTX Group's collapse could force businesses and investors to return billions of dollars paid in the months leading up to the collapse of the crypto exchange’s collapse.
- A “clawback” refers to money paid out that is required to be returned due to special circumstances or events, such as an insolvent company that needs to recover funds paid within 90 days before filing for Chapter 11.
- Creditors could seek a clawback on transfers made by FTX to external parties, including the $2.1 billion paid by Binance when Binance exited its Series A investment in FTX.
- FTX's bankruptcy case may not be different from other bankruptcy cases involving fraud and mismanagement, said insolvency lawyer Mark Pfeiffer.
