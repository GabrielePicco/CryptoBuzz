A Starbucks collectible NFT project has been announced on the same day it released two new staff benefits that excluded unionized branches.

## Highlights

- Starbucks announced a new NFT project on the same day it released two new staff benefits that excluded unionized branches.
- The two separate announcements garnered very different levels of interest, despite being released simultaneously.
- In July, the coffee giant said that it wonâ€™t offer any new benefits while bargaining with unions.
- This is because, as reported by Law360, the new benefits will not be extended to an estimated 325 unionized Starbucks branches.
- At the same time, the firm unveiled two new benefits, namely a student loan management service and a Starbucks savings account.
- The latter pays money to its staff for reaching specific milestones.
