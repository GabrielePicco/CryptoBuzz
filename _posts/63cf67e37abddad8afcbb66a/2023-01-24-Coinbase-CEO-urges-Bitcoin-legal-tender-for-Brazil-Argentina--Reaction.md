Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal said that it would be difficult to implement a volatile asset as a national currency.

## Highlights

- Brazil and Argentina have announced they are preparing to create a common currency.
- Bitcoin CEO Brian Armstrong suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) would be the ‘right long-term bet’ and wonder if the two countries would consider it.
- Global Macro Investor founder and CEO Raoul Pal opposed the idea, saying it would be difficult to implement a volatile asset as a national currency.
- Another community member argued that with the Lightning Network, BTC becomes the “best medium of exchange’s” Armstrong suggested the move may be based on El Salvador, another Latin American country, recognizing Bitcoin as a legal tender back in 2021.
- El Salvador was able to build schools and a veterinary hospital using profits from its Bitcoin purchases.
