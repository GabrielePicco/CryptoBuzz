Long hailed by its advocates as a safe hedge during uncertain times, Bitcoin’s value has fallen steadily in recent weeks.

## Highlights

- One possibility is that crypto is still too confusing and too difficult for normal people to use, especially during a war.
- Another is that Bitcoin is too volatile to be useful as a hedge against economic and political instability.
- A professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania says that chaos cuts both ways.
- The same events that could be seen as “good for Bitcoin” in the short term could also be bad for Bitcoin over the long term, since they could draw the attention of regulators, he says.
- The price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments.
