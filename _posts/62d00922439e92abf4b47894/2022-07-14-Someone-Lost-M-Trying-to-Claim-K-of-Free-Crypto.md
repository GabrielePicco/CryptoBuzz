A scammer swindled $8 million in bitcoin and ether by targeting users of Uniswap, a popular crypto exchange. That $8 million came from just two victims.

## Highlights

- Scam targeted users of popular crypto exchange Uniswap, a decentralized exchange.
- Scammers sent fake tokens to two wallets, promising a free airdrop of tokens worth around $2,000.
- One victim lost $6.5 million in bitcoin and ether, another $3.96 million in ether.
- The company said there was no "exploitation" and that it will not send tokens without notice on multiple official channels.
- The scam was first reported as a hack of the exchange, before it was discovered to be a social-engineered phishing scheme.
- In April, Bored Ape Yacht Club owners received $100,000 for every ape NFT they owned.
