## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Federal Reserve maintained interest rates between 5% and 5.25% on October 3.
- The odds of Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, increasing rates in the next meeting remain high, a move that can significantly impact crypto liquidity and prices of top coins, including Bitcoin.
