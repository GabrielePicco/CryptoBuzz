Stablecoin outflow will rise in the context of the Fed doubling down on rate hikes, which makes traditional finance attractive for depositors to earn higher yields.

## Highlights

- Long-term bitcoin holders have not disposed of their holdings into the market weakness as short-term speculators are mainly responsible for the heavy selling that exacerbates the assetâ€™s nosedive.
- The report viewed such a phenomenon as a positive indicator of true believers less likely to deepen the selling pressure during turbulent periods.
- The ongoing bloodbath has been driven by the Fed-induced rate hikes and over-leveraged crypto firms, as well as miners being forced to offload their holdings when their lost-in-value collaterals were at risk of liquidation.
- The total market cap of stablecoins dropped from $162B in early May to $149B at the end of June.
