After the collapse of FTX, Web3 VCs say they believe in decentralized tech just as much as ever. What the hell else can they say?

## Highlights

- Even in the frigid cold of Crypto Winter, venture capital continues to pour in for certain lucky builders.
- VCs have to keep swimming by investing in crap, or they’ll die, even in a bear market.
- Some of the biggest funders in the space, like Babel Finance, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX’s own venture arm, caused some of the big explosions.
- Every VC firm and project I spoke to says they are being far more cautious than before with regard to investments.
- But eight-figure raises and sky-high valuations are still out there, much of it coming from the usual suspects, such as Ripple.
