## Highlights

- There are several keywords that reflect the current crypto market sentiment quite good.
- We picked "buy bitcoin" for a measurement of market newcomers and "btc usd" for already invested people that are interested in the current price movements (mostly non-HODLers) The keyword "coinbase" reflects newcomers as well as already invested beginners in the market.
- Last but not least, we chose "bitcoin crash" to measure the current fear of a crash.
