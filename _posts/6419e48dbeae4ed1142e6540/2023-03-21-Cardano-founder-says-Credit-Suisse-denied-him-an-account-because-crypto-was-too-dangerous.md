Amid a financial crisis that has affected several major banks, including Credit Suisse, Cardano's founder shared an ironic anecdote.

## Highlights

- Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson shared an anecdote involving his experience with the now-struggling bank.
- Credit Suisse refused to open an account for Hoskinson back in 2014, when he was the CEO of Ether (ETH) and based in Switzerland, with the explanation that cryptocurrencies were too dangerous and unstable to work with.
- Hoskinson pointed out the irony of all the troubles the bank was going through currently, in the context of its disapproving attitude toward crypto and Hoskinson himself nine years before.
- Meanwhile, the bank's stock has continued to tank as the UBS merger failed to quell investor fears, declining nearly 65% in the previous five days.
