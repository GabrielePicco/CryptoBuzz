Ethereum finally migrated to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. The event triggered a wave of selling which was probably propelled by those who bought

## Highlights

- ETH is forming its third straight red candlestick on the daily timeframe.
- The price has declined by some 15% in the past couple of days.
- The 30-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has lost the support of the ascending line (in green), which held its position above it for three months.
- This indicates that a further correction can begin so long as the bears drive the price below $1,420.
- Such a scenario can initially extend the price down to $1.280.
- The marketâ€™s current bearish sentiment will be exceedingly challenging to reclaim any lost support in this situation.
