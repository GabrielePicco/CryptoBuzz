The sparse indictment against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is tight-lipped on prosecutors' sights on others in his circle, like Caroline Ellison.

## Highlights

- Caroline Ellison, Sam Bankman-Fried's onetime girlfriend, ran his crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, may be in the crosshairs, legal experts say.
- Ellison's rise as CEO at Alameda may put her in investigators' sights.
- Federal prosecutors are still on the case, but could bring new charges and target other defendants, experts said.
- Ellison hasn't been heard from in public since her arrest in the Bahamas on Tuesday.
- The criminal indictment against Bankman Fried made no mention of Ellison, but the SEC's civil suit references her statements on the relationship between FTX and Alameda.
- Ellison was once the vice president of Stanford Law School, where she set her sights on understanding how to allocate money.
