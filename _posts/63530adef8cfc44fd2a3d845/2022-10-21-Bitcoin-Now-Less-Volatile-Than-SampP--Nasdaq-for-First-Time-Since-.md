For the first time in two years, Bitcoin is officially less volatile than equities. Is crypto starting to decouple from traditional finance?

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's 20-day realized volatility has fallen below Nasdaq and S&P 500's level for first time in two years.
- First time since October 2020 that Bitcoin has been less volatile than Nasdaq.
- Kaiko data provider says volatility in both crypto markets and equities had hit a 40-year high.
- Despite low volatility, Bitcoin now appears to be acting as a sort of buffer against macroeconomic uncertainties.Kaiko's director of research Clara Medalie told Decrypt that “BTC volatility has been falling since early July,” which is around the time when the industry began to take stock of the liquidity crisis that emerged in the wake of Terra’s collapse.
