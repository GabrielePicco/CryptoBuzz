JPMorgan analysts have warned bitcoin's cost of production has dropped by more than $10,000 per bitcoin in just over a month...

## Highlights

- JPMorgan analysts have warned bitcoin's cost of production has dropped by more than $10,000 per bitcoin in just over a month.
- The cost to "mine" one bitcoin has dropped from $24,000 at the start of June to around $13,000 now.
- JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note this week that was first reported by Bloomberg.
- A decline in production costs could potentially wipe $160 billion from bitcoin's near-$400 billion market capitalization.
- The closely-watched $20,000 bitcoin price level is psychologically important as it was the peak of the late-2017 bitcoin bull run.
