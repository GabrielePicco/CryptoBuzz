The Metaverse is not yet for everyone – that’s probably the most important lesson learned the hard way by the European Union after a party it threw that cost

## Highlights

- The European Union spent €387,000 (around $400,000) on a ‘virtual party’ that was burdened with the mission to invite the youth to explore the so called limitless potential of the Metaverse.
- The gala was supposed to be “fun with music” and intended to spark the interest of young people on the digital and augmented reality realm.
- The party was a vital component of the Global Gateway Initiative of the European Commission aiming to devote funds of up to €300 billion to put up various infrastructures in developing countries by the year 2027.
- There were only six individuals who turned up at the metaverse party.
