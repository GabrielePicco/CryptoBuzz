Vitalik Buterin, along with a few core Ethereum developers, claimed that The Merge will be completed in August this year.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin, along with a few core ETH developers, claimed that The Merge will be completed in August this year.
- This should happen before the “difficulty bomb’s” slows down the network.
- The team wants to avoid another delay this time and complete The Merge before the blockchain slows down.
- Previously, another developer – Tim Beiko – said The Merge could not happen in June as expected, but it will most likely occur a few months later.
- If there are some potential risks, September or October is also possible, says Vitalik.
- The difficulty bomb has been postponed several times in the past to make sure the network continues to function correctly.
