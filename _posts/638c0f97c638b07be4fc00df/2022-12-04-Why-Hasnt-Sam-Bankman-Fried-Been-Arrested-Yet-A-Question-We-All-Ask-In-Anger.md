Bernie Madoff was arrested in a matter of days after his fraud came to light, but SBF is still a free man. What gives?

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of misdeeds at FTX and is living in the Bahamas.
- Bob Greene says comparisons to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme have resurfaced as a point of comparison.
- Greene: The comparison does not withstand more than a few minutes’ worth of scrutiny.
- He says those seeking immediate action by the Department of Justice should just have to be patient.
- Greene says it will take a long time to get to the bottom of the case by conducting an investigation that could take a lot of time, which will take the Justice Department's leadership to find out what really happened to the FTX fiasco.
