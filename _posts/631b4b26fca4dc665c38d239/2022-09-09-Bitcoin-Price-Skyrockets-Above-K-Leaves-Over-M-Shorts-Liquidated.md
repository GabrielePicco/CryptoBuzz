Bitcoin's price increased by a whopping 7% in the past 24 hours - a move that left over $160 million worth of short positions liquidated.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price increased by a whopping 7% in the past 24 hours - a move that left over $160 million worth of short positions liquidated.
- This has left a considerable amount of liquidated positions – a total of $215 million.
- The largest single liquidation order took place on OKEx, and it was a BTC-USDT swap with a face value of $3.62 million.
- It’s also worth noting that the increased volatility comes a day after the European Central Bank hiked interest rates by 75 bps – a move many consider long-term bearish for the crypto market.
- The rest of the cryptocurrency market has also followed suit, but it appears that BTC is the predominant leader.
