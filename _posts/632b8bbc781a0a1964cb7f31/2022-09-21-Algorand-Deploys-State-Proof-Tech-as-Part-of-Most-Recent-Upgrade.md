The Goal. State proofs enable our blockchain to digitally sign any given message in a way that is easily verifiable by everyone. This is clearly a fundamental ability for a blockchain. Wait a moment…

## Highlights

- Algorand's new state proof allows the chain to digitally sign any given message in a way that is easily verifiable by everyone.
- State Proofs enable the chain’s consensus to be open to all willing participants.
- A state proof is compact, secure, and super easy to verify, and extremely easy to do so.
- The blockchain is a worthy aspiration that we must be sustained and realized by state proof technology, at the same time they are enabled by other technologies, such as Falcon technologies, that we have already made available on our chain and to build a host of new technologies, underlie the promise of state proof technologies.
- The state proofs enable the construction of decentralized bridges and other blockchains, safe against quantum attacks, “
