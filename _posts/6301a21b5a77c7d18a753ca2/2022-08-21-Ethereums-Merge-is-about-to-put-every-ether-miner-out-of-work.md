The ambitious change is expected to cut energy consumption by a factor of 1,000.

## Highlights

- In a few weeks, "the Merge" is set to make a major change to the "Eminor-work" system.
- The switch to proof-of-stake is expected to cut energy consumption by a factor of 1,000.
- A botched transition could mean chaos for the many crypto projects built on top of the Ethereum network.
- Critics worry that the new scheme could cause the network to become overly centralized and vulnerable to government regulation.
- The new system doesn't require the same kind of beefy hardware—or the massive electricity bill that goes with it.
- The most immediate consequence of a successful transition will be to put the world's miners out of work.
