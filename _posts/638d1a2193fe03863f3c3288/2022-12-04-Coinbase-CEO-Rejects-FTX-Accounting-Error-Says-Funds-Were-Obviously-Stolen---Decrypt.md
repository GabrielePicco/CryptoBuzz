Brian Armstrong says only the “most gullible person” would believe an $8 billion hole was due to lackluster accounting.

## Highlights

- Brian Armstrong says only the “most gullible person” would believe FTX’s $8 billion hole was due to lackluster accounting.
- Armstrong: “It's stolen customer money used in his hedge fund, plain and simple.” The collapse of FTX has tainted investors’ faith in crypto when it comes to both the price of digital assets and equities tied to the industry.
- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” has claimed he didn’t “knowingly commingle funds” between FTX and Alameda Research, a hedge fund co-founded by SBF.
