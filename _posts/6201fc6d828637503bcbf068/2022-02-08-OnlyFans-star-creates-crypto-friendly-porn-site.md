Allie Rae, 37, quit her job as a nurse in a Boston intensive care unit after her co-workers and bosses discovered that she had an account on OnlyFans.

## Highlights

- Allie Rae, 37, quit her $84,000-a-year job as a Boston intensive care unit to pursue a career on OnlyFans.
- She earned almost $369,000 for each month she was on the site last year.
- Next month, she plans to officially launch WetSpace, an adult entertainment space that will process payments in cryptocurrency.
- OnlyFans, which said it was pressured to ban porn by large payment processors concerned about facilitating sex trafficking, reversed its decision amid intense backlash.
- The married mother-of-three said she invested $1 million of her own money into the venture, though the backers have insisted on remaining anonymous.
