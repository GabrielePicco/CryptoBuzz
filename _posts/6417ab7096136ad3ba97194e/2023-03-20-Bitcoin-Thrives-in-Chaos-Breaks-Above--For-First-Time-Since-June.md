## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price topped $28,000 for the first time since June 2022.
- Since the start of the year, Bitcoin’s price has risen almost 70%.
- Bitcoin bulls see the digital asset as a hedge against inflation, despite last year's evidence to the contrary.
- It's unclear how the central bank will respond to the conflicting signals at this week's Fed meeting.
- The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% on Friday, but Bitcoin's rise has dissipated this month as the correlation between the token and the S-P 500 dissipated.
- The largest digital asset is correlated with liquidity conditions and real rates, an analyst says.
