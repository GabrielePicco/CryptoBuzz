The Merge is planned for September 19, according to the latest roadmap from Ethereum developers.

## Highlights

- Developers have doubled down on a mid-September target for the Merge.
- The Merge is the transition from a proof-of-work to a consensus mechanism.
- The upgrade is expected to slash the blockchainâ€™s energy use and, therefore, carbon emissions, by as much as 99%.
- No objections were raised to the suggested timeline, according to one prominent developer.
- After the successful merges of the Ropsten and Sepolia testnets, the Goerli testnet is planned for Aug.
- 11.
