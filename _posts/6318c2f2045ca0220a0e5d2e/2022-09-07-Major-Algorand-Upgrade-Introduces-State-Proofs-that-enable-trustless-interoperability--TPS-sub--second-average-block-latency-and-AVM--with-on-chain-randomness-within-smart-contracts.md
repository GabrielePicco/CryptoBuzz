Today, I am thrilled to announce the latest release of the Algorand protocol — Algorand 3.9. With the introduction of State Proofs that enable trustless interoperability, 6000 TPS, sub 4 second…

## Highlights

- Algorand is committed to exceeding end-user requirements and ensuring you never need to wait on a transaction.
- The network now produces larger blocks (5Mib) and produces blocks faster (sub 4 second block latency and finality) AVM 7 with on chain randomness within smart contracts is a highly sought-after feature for dApp developers.
- The code is available on Github.
- If you find bugs or have any ideas for improvement, please file an issue.
- The latest release will be available next week once the network completes the upgrade.
- The release is available to the end of the week for the network to upgrade to 3.9.
