Markets are going to get rocked as the Federal Reserve pushes interest rates higher, said top Fed watcher Ricardo Reis.

## Highlights

- Ricardo Reis says the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates more than the markets now expect.
- The London School of Economics economist says the Fed is "biased toward over-tightening" The Fed raised the top end of its benchmark rate range to 4.5% last month.
- Reis: If wages don’t rise much, inflation can quickly return to the Fed’s 2% target.
- The Fed might overreact to the rise in wages, he said, but there is a range — it could be ‘much much more’ or “much more” or ‘just more,” Reis said.
