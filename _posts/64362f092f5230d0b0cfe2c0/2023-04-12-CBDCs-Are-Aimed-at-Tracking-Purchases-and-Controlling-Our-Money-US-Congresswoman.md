Tulsi Gabbard believes CBDCs will be used to track all consumer purchases and eliminate cash.

## Highlights

- Tulsi Gabbard is taking a stand against the Biden administration’s plans to develop a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States.
- A CBDC is a new form of digital money issued directly by a central bank to retail customers, rather than through commercial banks.
- The former congresswoman believes CBDCs will be used as tools of mass financial surveillance that “undermine our autonomy and freedom” The federal government has already begun to implement its CBDC project, which will “bring about a cashless society where every transaction we make is tracked, monitored, and controlled,” she wrote.
