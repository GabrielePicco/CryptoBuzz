One cannot deny how NFT Worlds has fallen from grace and struggles to find new support levels and new users for its metaverse.

## Highlights

- Metaverse projects tend to attract tremendous attention during the initial phase.
- NFT Worlds is a victim, as its non-fungible assets currently trade over 94% below their all-time high.
- The project is a limitless world and is fully Minecraft-compatible.
- The past month saw a 25.6% decline in social mentions, despite a 10.7% gain in social contributors.
- The current price floor for NFT Worldâ€™s assets is between 0.71 ETH and 0.85 ETH.
- That is still a good value, but a problematic situation for long-term holders.
