Bitcoin has hit the mainstream. Former President of the New York Stock Exchange, has said that, \"It will have to be part of a portfolio.”

## Highlights

- Former President of the New York Stock Exchange, Thomas Farley said Bitcoin is ‘trusted, censorship-resistant, there will only ever be 21 million, and it will have to be part of a portfolio” Farley is an American banker, and current CEO of Far Point Acquisition Corp.
- Farley has been a strong supporter of Bitcoin, but he does temper this opinion with the occasional warning.
- Bitcoin is a store of value but the price fluctuations are much, much higher than other stores of value.
- The ‘to the moon’ verbiage is dangerous.
- Yes, the upside potential of holding btc is high, but so, too, is the downside.
