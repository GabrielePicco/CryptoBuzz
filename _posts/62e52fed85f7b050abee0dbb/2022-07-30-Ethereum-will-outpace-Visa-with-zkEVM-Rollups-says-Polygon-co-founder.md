Ethereum's transaction throughput could overtake Visa's thanks to zkEVM scaling, says Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic.

## Highlights

- Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic says zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum could outpace Visa in terms of transaction throughput.
- Polygon recently claimed to be the first to implement a new scaling solution.
- This layer-2 protocol can bundle together several transactions and relay them to the Ethereum network as a single transaction.
- The solution represents the Holy Grail of Web3 as it offers security, scalability and compatibility with the smart contract protocol.
- If further upgraded, the solution could one day handle thousands of transactions per second, thus outpacing mainstream payment systems like Visa's, he said in an interview with Cointelegraph.
