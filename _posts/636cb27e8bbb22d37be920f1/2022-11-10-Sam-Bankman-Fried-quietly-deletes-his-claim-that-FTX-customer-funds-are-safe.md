The future of client assets locked on crypto exchange FTX remains uncertain, with a Binance deal that can bail out the company depending on a closer look at the books.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried told his Twitter community everything was fine and customer assets were safe.
- FTX's collapse of FTX, the third largest crypto exchange by trading volume, over just 48 hours was an epochal moment for the still fledgling industry.
- In a potentially worrying sign, the 30-year-old former billionaire expunged the record of those assurances ahead of a planned sale to larger rival Binance that could still go wrong.
- In the space of just one day, the failed exchangeâ€™s native FTT token lost 75% of its value.
- In the event of a failure, funds can be liable to seizure by administrator for liquidation to pay off creditors.
