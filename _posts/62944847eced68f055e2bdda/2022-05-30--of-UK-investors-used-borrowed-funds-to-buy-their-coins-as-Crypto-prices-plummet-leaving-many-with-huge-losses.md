60% of UK investors used borrowed funds to buy their coins as Crypto prices plummet leaving many with huge losses ...

## Highlights

- A study by KIS Finance has revealed that over two thirds of cryptocurrency investors have used one or more credit facilities to make their purchase.
- 64% of those who have invested in cryptos, used a credit card or personal loan to make the purchase.
- Those aged between 18 and 24 were the age group most likely to use borrowed funds.
- Prices of the main cryptocurrencies have fallen by as much as 100% in the last month.
- This dramatic fall will leave many facing huge losses, whilst still saddled with the cost of repaying their original borrowing.
- The appeal of crypto currencies seems to be particularly strong with Generation Z (those currently under the age of 25), who are attracted by the decentralised nature of the market.
