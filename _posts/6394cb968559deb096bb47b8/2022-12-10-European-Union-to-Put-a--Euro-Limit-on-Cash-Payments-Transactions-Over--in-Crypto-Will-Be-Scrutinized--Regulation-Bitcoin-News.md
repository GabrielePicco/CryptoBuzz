The states of the European Union have convened to establish a new limit on cash purchases and to strengthen the controls on crypto movements.

## Highlights

- European Union to put a 10,000-Euro Limit on Cash Payments; Transactions over €1,000 in Crypto Will be Scrutinized.
- The bloc agreed to establish a limit of €10,000 ($10,557) on cash payments and to exert stronger oversight on crypto transactions of over 1,000 euros ($1,055) Transactions will be subject to the same level of anti-money laundering and terrorism financing scrutiny that other financial institutions already face.
- The European Central Bank (ECB) expressed its disagreement with this back in 2018, when the institution qualified the measure as “disproportionate” as it could limit the usage of cash as an effective legal tender.
