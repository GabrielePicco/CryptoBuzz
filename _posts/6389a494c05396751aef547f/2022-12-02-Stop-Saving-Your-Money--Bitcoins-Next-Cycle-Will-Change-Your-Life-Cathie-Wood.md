When you think about what most people are doing in their late 50s, it comes closer to winding down instead running a $60 Billion investment fund. Woods’s actual net worth is unclear because it’s…

## Highlights

- Cathie Wood is a self-made millionaire who founded ARK Invest eight years ago when she was 59.
- Her net worth is unclear because it’s closely tied to her investment performance, but some commentators estimate it to be in the region of $250 million.
- She has had her fair share of scrutiny throughout her career, which most world-class investors do.
- During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Woods was the Chief Investment Officer of Alliance Berstein and her performance was criticised for being worse than the S&P 500 and the overall stock market.
- She called out Michael Burry on social media after “The Big Short” investor placed a bet against her company.
