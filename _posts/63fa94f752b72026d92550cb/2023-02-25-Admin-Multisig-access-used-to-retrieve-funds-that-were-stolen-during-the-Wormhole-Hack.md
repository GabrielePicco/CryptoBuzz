A Statement Regarding The Transactions From The Oasis Multisig on 21st Feb 2023

## Highlights

- The Oasis Multisig received an order from the High Court of England and Wales to take all necessary steps to retrieve certain assets involved with the wallet address associated with the Wormhole Exploit on the 2nd February 2022.
- This was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the court order, as required by law.
- The assets were immediately passed onto a wallet controlled by the authorised third party.
- We retain no control or access to these assets.
- We stress that this access was there with the sole intention to protect user assets in the event of any potential attack.
- At no point, in the past or present, have user assets been at risk of being accessed by any unauthorised party.
