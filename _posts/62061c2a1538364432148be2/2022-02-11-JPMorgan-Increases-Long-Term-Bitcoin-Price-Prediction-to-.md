Strategists at Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan have updated what they consider to be a “fair value” price for Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- JPMorgan Chase strategists say Bitcoin’s “fair value” should be 12% lower than its actual price.
- The figure is based on the premise that BTC is four times more volatile than gold.
- JPMorgan Chase has increased its long-term price prediction for Bitcoin to $150,000.
- The report is generally bearish, but it is a testament to how far crypto assets have come that major Wall Street banks (that previously hated them) are now advising investors about them and predicting prices.
- Bitcoin is currently trading down 36.7% from its Nov.
- 10 all-time high of $69K.
