Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has expounded on his exchange’s policies, asserting that a complete ban on Russian users would be “unethical.”

## Highlights

- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a Bloomberg interview that his exchange complies with sanctions on Russian users.
- Zhao also asserted that the exchange would not impose a complete ban on Russia users as an entire group.
- Ukraine has also asked several other exchanges to ban Russian users, according to reports from Coindesk.
- Binance said that it was “blocking accounts of those on the sanctions list” in a statement to Reuters, and that it would not “unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users’ accounts’s accounts” at the present time.
- On whether sanctioned Russian oligarchs could be trading on Binance anonymously, Zhao said that his entire exchange relies on identity verification.
