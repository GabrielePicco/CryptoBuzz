Meanwhile, the total value locked inside the Terra blockchain system has already reached an all-time high of $25.58 billion.

## Highlights

- LUNA's price reached nearly $100 on March 9 following a 15% intraday rally, coming near its record high of $106 from December 2021.
- LUNA price increased because of Terra’s ability to capture at least $1 trillion or more worth of decentralized stablecoin market space via its native U.S.
- dollar-pegged token, TerraUSD (UST) LUNA.
- The total value locked inside the Terra protocol surged from nearly $18 billion at the beginning of this year to $25.58 billion as of March 9, its highest level to date.
- Meanwhile, LUNA looks poised to establish a new record high this week, but technical indicators suggest the possibility of downside risk.
