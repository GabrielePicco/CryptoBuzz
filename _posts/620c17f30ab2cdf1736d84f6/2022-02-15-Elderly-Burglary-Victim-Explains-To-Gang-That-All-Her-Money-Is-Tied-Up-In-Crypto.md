Eithne Brenahan has a wallet full of Doge coins and NFTs. The gang were unable to comprehend the inner workings of the crypto-currency.

## Highlights

- Eithne Brenahan, 86, has recently invested her life savings in NFTs.
- The pensioner said she had nothing of value in his home as she had invested in cryptocurrency.
- The criminal gang, probably from Dublin, were unable to comprehend the inner workings of blockchain-based investment and fled the scene in a bid to go rob someone else while the night was young.
- Meanwhile, financial experts didn’t think now was the time to tell Ms Branahan that cryptocurrency probably wasn”t any safer or more secure in the long run that having a shoebox full of fifties in her wardrobe was no longer secure.
