Despite the turmoil, CoinFund’s David Pakman is bullish on investing right now—but perhaps not in the U.S.

## Highlights

- Recent collapses of Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank dealt a blow to the broader startup ecosystem, and in particular, to crypto startups.
- The first recent knock on the industry followed the collapse of SVB and pro-crypto Signature Bank last month.
- The second punch came when the SEC sent stalwart crypto exchange Coinbase a Wells Notice on March 22, indicating the firm will face imminent legal action and alleging that it may be listing unregistered securities.
- Despite the myriad blows to the industry over the last 12 months or so, from the implosion of FTX to now increased SEC scrutiny and banking troubles, they always seem to get back up to fight another day.
