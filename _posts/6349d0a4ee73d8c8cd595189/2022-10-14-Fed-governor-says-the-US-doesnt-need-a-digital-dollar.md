Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller expanded on his opposition to a U.S. central bank digital currency.

## Highlights

- Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller expanded on his opposition to a U.S.
- central bank digital currency.
- Waller sees privately-issued stablecoins strengthening, rather than weakening, the dollar, since so many are pegged to the world’s dominant fiat currency.
- The effects of a foreign CBDC taking off, Waller said, “will likely only be on the margin because they rely on a large enough number of individuals and businesses being nearly indifferent between the dollar and the foreign currency in CBDC form” The new payments technology must also be “risk-managed and subject to a robust supervisory and regulatory framework,” said Waller.
