The survey shows 43% of the public with a negative view of cryptocurrencies, up from 25% in March.

## Highlights

- Survey shows 43% of the public with a negative view of cryptocurrencies, up from 25% in March.
- The percentage with a positive view plummeted to just 8% from 19%, and those who are neutral fell almost in half to 18% from 31%.
- The survey of 800 Americans nationwide was conducted Nov.
- 26-30 and has a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.
- It's a dramatic fall for an investment that was touted as its own asset class and had a celebrated coming-out party on the global stage with multiple Super Bowl ads and celebrity endorsements.
- It could still be a problem for crypto recovering its credibility since reputation looks to be central to its valuation.
