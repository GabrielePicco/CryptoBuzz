The sale of assets took place shortly after another wave of layoffs at Coinbase.

## Highlights

- The sale of 29,732 shares by Brian Armstrong brought in a total of $1,625,151.12.
- The sale was performed at a price approximately 20% worse than the median price of the company's stock over the past two months.
- If the sale had occurred at COIN’s peak, it would have been worth over $10.36 million.
- At its highest price point of 2022, one Coinbase share was worth $348.49 – a figure over six times higher than the current average price during the selloff.
- The selloff could also indicate that the interest of investors in the company is increasing – especially since they’ve managed to ride the crypto winter out pretty well.
