Ether withdrawals from the Beacon Chain have now hit 1 million ETH worth $2.1 billion, just four days after the April 12 Shapella hard fork pushed Ether to its highest price in 11 months.

## Highlights

- Ether has pushed over $2,100 for the first time in 11 months after Shapella hard fork.
- Over 1 million Ether (ETH) worth $2.1 billion has been withdrawn from the Beacon Chain within the first four days of the hard-fork.
- Nearly 87% or 469,000 of the 540,000 active validators are now able to withdraw their staked Ether.
- The figures are of little “surprise” to Lachlan Feeney, chief executive of blockchain consulting and development firm Labrys, who told Cointelegraph that many validators have re-staking Ether back onto the chain.
