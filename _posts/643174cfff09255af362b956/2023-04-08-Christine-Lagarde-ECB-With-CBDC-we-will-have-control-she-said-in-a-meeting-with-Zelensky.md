Christine Lagarde said that the ECB would have control over transactions with a CBDC. It is needed but a threshold of €300 - €400 could be considered before a transaction would be checked.

## Highlights

- Christine Lagarde admitted that “there will be control” in regard to a digital euro.
- She said this in a meeting with a fake Zelensky impersonator.
- It later turned out that the person claiming to be the Ukrainian president was in fact not Volodymyr Zelenky.
- The crypto community has reacted heavily to the viral video of Lagarde saying that the ECB is heading is a catastrophic outcome in terms of privacy, control, and financial stability of economies.
- But a big part of the crypto community believes that the introduction of a Euro CBDC will be good for investors and individuals to flock to $BTC and other cryptocurrencies.
