Exploring the declining world of NFTs

## Highlights

- The market for Beanie Babies crashed along with the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the dropping prices caused the market to be flooded with an avalanche of inventory.
- Investors are justifying the value by arguing that these are Non-Fungible (as in, one of a kind that cannot be duplicated) Investors are paying more than 6 figures for an image of a rock in the hope that down the line its value is going to increase.
- Jack Dorseyâ€™s first tweet as an NFT has lost more than 99.99% value in just under a year.
- Cryptopunk that was sold for more than $1MM just a year back is now trading at < $60K (~94% drop)
