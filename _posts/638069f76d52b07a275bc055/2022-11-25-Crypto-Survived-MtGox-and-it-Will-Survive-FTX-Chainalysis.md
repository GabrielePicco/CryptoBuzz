There is little doubt that the collapse of FTX has been the largest black swan event in recent years in crypto, but was it as big as Mt.Gox?

## Highlights

- Analytics firm Chainalysis made the Mt.Gox comparison as it was not the first time the crypto world has been shaken due to an exchange demise.
- The Japan-based exchange was hacked in early 2014, resulting in the loss of around 750K BTC, or 6% of the entire supply at the time.
- Chainalysis concluded that the crypto industry has survived worse than the fall of FTX, so there is “no reason it can’t bounce back from this, stronger than ever” Since its bear cycle low earlier this week, total market capitalization has recovered by $44 billion.Crypto markets are up 3% on the day, and the total cap is now $865 billion.
