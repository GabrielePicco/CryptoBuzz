The cryptocurrency markets recovered a respectable $60 billion in a day as Bitcoin's price reclaimed $30K.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price is trading at around $30,700 (on Binance), up 5.3% in the past 24 hours.
- Altcoins in the green, with altcoins charting notable increases.
- Despite the surge, BTC still closed the previous weekly candle in the red.
- This makes for nine consecutive red weekly candles – an unprecedented event in the cryptocurrency’s history.
- The market remains in a state of extreme fear, and it appears that the sentiment is even worse than yesterday as it currently sits at 10 points.
- Most of the cryptocurrencies are currently trading towards the top of the mid-term range, so it's important to be vigilant.
