Celsius tapped Quickbooks, software primarily used by smaller businesses, to keep track of its finances—just like the bankrupt FTX.

## Highlights

- Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius used Quickbooks to keep track of its finances, a court-appointed examiner wrote in a report released Tuesday.
- The lender's use of Quickbooks mirrors accounting methods put in practice by bankrupt FTX under disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
- Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July of last year after it had paused customer withdrawals and swaps the month before.
- The crypto lender owes clients and creditors $5.5 billion, and its debts are now $5 billion.
- The examiner found “significant discrepancies” between account balances in the Quickbooks files downloaded from Celsius’s account and those used to create consolidated statements.
