Bitcoin seems to have reached a point when even its biggest and most bullish admirers and investors are slowly losing hope in the crypto asset altogether.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin seems to have reached a point when even its biggest and most bullish admirers and investors are slowly losing hope in the crypto asset altogether.
- Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, who, back in March 2022, said the maiden cryptocurrency will hit $500,000 by 2027, dialed down his predictions owing to the subpar performance of BTC.
- At the time of this writing, BTC is changing hands at $17,017, having lost more than 70% of its value at the same time last year.
- It still remains the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, but its overall valuation is currently at $327.04 billion.
