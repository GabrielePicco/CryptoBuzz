- The cryptocurrency hadnâ€™t recorded such a prolonged winning streak since July 2021, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Over the last seven days, the price of BTC has increased nearly 8%, with a 4.1% surge in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.
- The wider crypto market also faced headwinds resulting from numerous bankruptcies and collapses in the space in the same year including crypto exchange FTX, the second-largest exchange at its bankruptcy.
