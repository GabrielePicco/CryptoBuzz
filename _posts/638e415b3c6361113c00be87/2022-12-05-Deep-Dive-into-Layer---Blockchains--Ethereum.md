In this series of articles, we’re going to take a deep dive into several layer-1 blockchains and examine various criteria of each, including security, decentralization, scalability, the state of…

## Highlights

- A deep dive into layer-1 blockchains to examine various criteria of each, including security, decentralization, scalability, the state of DeFi, NFTs, and innovation.
- In the wake of The Merge, many concerns have been raised about Ethereum’s decentralization.
- To run a validator node and earn rewards on your staked ETH at home, you would need to pledge at least 32 ETH which, as of today, is worth roughly $37,000.
- This extremely large amount of money makes it unapproachable for the average investors to run their own validator nodes on their own.
- This is a good and healthy sign that the network is going in the right direction.
