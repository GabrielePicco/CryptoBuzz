Cybercrime apparently doesn't pay what it used to, as cybersecurity tools and US investigators thwart some ransomware groups, according to the WSJ.

## Highlights

- One hacker group reportedly laid off 45 call-center operators last year.
- The US government and cybersecurity tools are effectively fighting certain cyberattacks, according to the WSJ.
- The increased vigilance has led to declines in the number of such online ransomware attacks that certain cybersecurity professionals fielded last year and the size of ransom payments that hackers were trying to get for them, cybersecurity groups told the Wall Street Journal.
- The DOJ has signaled in recent years that it is ramping up its policing of cybercrime.
- In 2021, the agency created new groups internally, including the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team and the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force.
- The agency has also stepped up its oversight amid high-profile attacks on domestic infrastructure.
