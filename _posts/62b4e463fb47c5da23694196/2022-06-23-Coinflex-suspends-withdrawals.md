Dear CoinFLEX Community,

## Highlights

- CoinFLEX will also be halting all FLEX Coin trading in perps and spot in the short term.
- The counterparty is not 3 Arrows Capital or any lending firm.
- We are confident that this situation can be repaired fully with a restoration of all functionality, namely withdrawals.
- We fully expect to resume withdrawals in a better position as soon as possible.
- The next update: June 27th, 2022.
