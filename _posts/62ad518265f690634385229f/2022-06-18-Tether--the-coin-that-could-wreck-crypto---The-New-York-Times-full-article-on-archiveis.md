Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary access to the web property. If you are on a personal connection, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not

## Highlights

- Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary access to the web property.
- If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device.
- You can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices.
- If you're at an office or shared network,   Â you can ask for a scan of the network to find out what is wrong with your devices and if you're not infected with malware, it could be a good sign that your device is not infected or mis-configured, it will not be infected.
