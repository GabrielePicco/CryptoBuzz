\"Meta would be one step closer to its ultimate goal of owning the entire 'Metaverse,'\" the FTC's complaint says.

## Highlights

- Federal Trade Commission files suit to stop Facebook from acquiring virtual reality app.
- Complaint details Facebook's acquisition of virtual reality apps, including virtual reality fitness app.
- "The acquisition of new users, content, and developers each feed into one another, creating a self-reinforcing cycle," the complaint says.
- The acquisition is scheduled to take place at midnight on August 1, the FTC said on July 27, with the deadline set for August 1.
- The complaint appears to have redacted a number of adjectives describing the market position of Facebook, Facebook and its apps and its app, including that of Supernatural, which is due to be released on August 27.
