## Highlights

- Folding@Home is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics.
- It rewards people who use their hardware to run simulations using the CPU, GPU, or both.
- By studying protein folding, scientists can work to understand more about diseases and work to create and improve medicines that can help fight against them.
- The faster your hardware can crunch a simulation, the more points you will earn, and you are rewarded with Banano (BAN) crypto sent directly to your crypto wallet.
- You can also earn bonus points along the way by securing your account with a passcode, or getting a BANMiner User ID, Team, and Passcode.
