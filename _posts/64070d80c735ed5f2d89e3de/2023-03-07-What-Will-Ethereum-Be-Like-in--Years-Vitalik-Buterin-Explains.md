Vitalik Buterin said Rollups would come to maturity in 2023 thanks to EIP-4848. The blockchain can be called ‘done’ by the end of 2023 after implementing proof-of-stake

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin said Rollups would come to maturity in 2023 thanks to EIP-4848.
- The blockchain can be called ‘done’ by the end of 2023 after implementing proof-of-stake withdrawals.
- Rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions that compile a bunch of transactions, turn them into one single data, and submit it to the mainnet.
- The ultimate goal was to ensure that the Ethereum ecosystem could support 500 million users before the bull came knocking, according to the crypto influencer.
- The team could halt further developments after the migration to proof of stake, implementing withdrawals, and adding enough cryptography to the blockchain.
