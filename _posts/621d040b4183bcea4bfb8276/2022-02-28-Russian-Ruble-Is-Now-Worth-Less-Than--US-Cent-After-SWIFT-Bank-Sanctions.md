The Russian currency dropped nearly 26% to 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday. The U.S., Japan and other Western nations imposed restrictions on access for some Russian banks to the SWIFT global bank payments system.

## Highlights

- The Russian currency dropped nearly 26% to 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar.
- The U.S., Japan and other Western nations imposed restrictions on access for some Russian banks to the SWIFT global bank payments system.
- The drop of the Russian currency would likely send inflation soaring, hurting all Russians and not just the targets of earlier sanctions.
- The Russian central bank has more than $600 billion in reserves at its disposal, hindering its ability to support the currency.
- The move was announced Saturday, leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate the penalties later in the wake of Russiaâ€™s invasion of eastern Ukraine.
