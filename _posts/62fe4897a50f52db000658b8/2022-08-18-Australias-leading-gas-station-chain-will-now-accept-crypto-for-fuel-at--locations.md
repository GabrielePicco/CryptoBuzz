Australians will now be able to pay for fuel through Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at stations and convenience stores under OTR brand.

## Highlights

- Australians will now be able to pay for fuel through Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at stations and convenience stores under the leading On The Run brand for the service powered by Crypto.com.
- The service is available in 175 OTR stations in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia states.
- Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) chairman Joe Longo noted that the rise of assets like Bitcoin and ETH means there is a need for regulating the sector.
- However, there is still an enormous demand for a stablecoin backed by the Australian dollar, Longo said in a report released at the start of August 2022, and 44% of retail investors in Australia indicated they owned cryptocurrencies.
