U.S. consumer prices accelerated again last month to the hottest print of the current inflation cycle.

## Highlights

- Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflected a year-over-year increase of 9.1% last month, up from the prior 40-year high of 8.6% in May.
- The S&P 500 dropped 1.3% at the open, while the Nasdaq shed 1.7%, and the Dow fell 1.1%.
- The continued surge in inflation was elevated by broad-based increases, including high food costs and record gasoline prices, which topped more than $5 per gallon at the pump last month.
- The White House warned in a call with reporters that June’s inflation numbers were likely to be “highly elevated”
