The one-time Ethereum killer has fallen sharply in 2022 as the crypto market buckles under the wreckage of FTX.

## Highlights

- Solana's market cap has slipped below that of the OG proof-of-work blockchain, Litecoin.
- Solana began 2022 trading at $178.89, with a market cap of $55.09 billion in January 2022.
- Now, SOL is trading at  $11.91, a 94.9% drop for the year.
- Litecoin is trading in November 22, 2022, at $69.36, a drop of 69.1%.
- FTX, along with its founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has long been associated with Solana, having participated in a $314 million fundraise by Solana Labs through Alameda Research.
