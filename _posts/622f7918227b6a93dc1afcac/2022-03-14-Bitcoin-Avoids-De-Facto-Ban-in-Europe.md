MiCA would have forced Proof-of-Work blockchains, like the one used by Bitcoin, to meet \"minimum environmental sustainability standards.\"

## Highlights

- EU's MiCA proposal would have forced Proof-of-Work blockchains to meet "minimum environmental sustainability standards" 32 MEPs voted against the proposal, with just 24 in favor of it.
- This result means that Bitcoin mining will no longer be regulated under the EU's sustainable finance policy.
- But the proposal could be discussed in a plenary session of the European Parliament if they have support from a tenth of MEPs, according to Unstoppable Finance's head of strategy Patrick Hansen, who said it was a "big relief" for the Bitcoin and crypto community in the EU, which has been criticized by some for not doing enough to regulate the mining industry.
