Companies may fail but the blockchain technology will stay, Chanpeng Zhao tells DIFC FinTech Week

## Highlights

- Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, the worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency exchange, spoke at DIFC FinTech Week.
- Mr Zhao made his debut on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index in January with a net worth of $96 billion.
- However, his fortune has plummeted to $20bn after a massive sell-off in digital currencies across the board, causing the sector's total market capitalisation to fall below $1 trillion.
- Bitcoin crashed below the key $20,000 psychological level last week as investors continued to steer clear of riskier assets amid concerns of rising interest rates as central banks try to rein in inflation.
- The digital token has since pared back its losses and was trading at $21,018 as of 2.51pm UAE time on Tuesday.
