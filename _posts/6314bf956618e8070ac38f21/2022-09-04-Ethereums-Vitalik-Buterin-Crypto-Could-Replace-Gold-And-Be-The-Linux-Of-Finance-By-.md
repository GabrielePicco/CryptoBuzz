Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin believes that cryptocurrencies will definitely settle down in the medium-term future.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin said he expects cryptocurrencies to only be as volatile as gold or the stock market in the next couple of decades.
- Bitcoin BTC/USD was trading at $19,811 and ETH at $1,554 at press time.
- The crypto market saw a 0.37% decline to $973 billion in the last 24 hours.
- The price of Bitcoin BTC was $31 to $2 in 2011, when most people did not know whether the digital asset was just a one-time fad or whether it would collapse for good, explained the ETH/USD creator in a recent interview with Noah Smith.
- The market was largely unchanged in price over the last day.
