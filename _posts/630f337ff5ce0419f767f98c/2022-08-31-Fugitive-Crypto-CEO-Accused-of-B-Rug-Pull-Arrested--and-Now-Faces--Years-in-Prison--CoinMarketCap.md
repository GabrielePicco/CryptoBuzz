Last April, Faruk Fatih Özer had released a statement where he vowed to repay those who lost money and return to Turkey to face the consequences — but he never did.

## Highlights

- Faruk Fatih Özer was the founder of Thodex, a trading platform that collapsed last year.
- It's estimated thousands of customers lost $24 million.
- Last April, Özer had released a statement where he vowed to repay those who lost money and return to Turkey to face the consequences.
- Turkish prosecutors want to sentence him to 40,000 years in prison.
- He was captured in the city of Vlora at dawn on Tuesday, and work is now underway to extradite him.
- The company projected that over $2 billion was lost in what was the biggest rug pull of the year — representing 90% of the funds lost through this type of scam in 2021.
