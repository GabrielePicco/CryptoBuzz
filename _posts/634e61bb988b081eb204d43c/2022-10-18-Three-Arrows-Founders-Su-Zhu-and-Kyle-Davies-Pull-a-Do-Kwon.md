Three Arrows' liquidator asked a judge to allow it to issue subpoenas via Twitter and email to the fund’s founders who have vanished.

## Highlights

- Liquidator to wind down affairs of bankrupt Singaporean hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has asked a judge to allow it to issue subpoenas.
- These will be sent via Twitter and email to the fund’s founders, who seem to have vanished into thin air.
- Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have only engaged the liquidators individually since an initial virtual meeting involving them both.
- Do Kwon has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with South Korean authorities since they issued a warrant for his arrest on Sep.
- 17, 2022, after he reportedly fled Singapore.
- He later went on record as saying that he was not “on the run.”
