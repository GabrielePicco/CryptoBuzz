Insider has identified numerous members of Congress who have violated the STOCK Act. Congress is now considering banning lawmakers from trading stocks.

## Highlights

- 73 members of Congress have failed to properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012.
- Their excuses range from oversights, to clerical errors, to inattentive accountants.
- Congress is now considering a ban on lawmakers from trading individual stocks, with a vote on a bill possible for November.
- Some lawmakers who violate the STOCK Act face a small fine, but the penalty is usually small — $200 is the standard amount — or waived by ethics officials.
- Here are the lawmakers discovered to have recently violated the law — to one extent or another: Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, and Sen.
- Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida.
