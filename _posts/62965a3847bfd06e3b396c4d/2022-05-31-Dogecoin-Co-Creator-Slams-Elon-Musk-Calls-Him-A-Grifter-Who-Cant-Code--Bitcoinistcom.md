Many people might be smitten with Elon Musk on Twitter, but one of the co-founders of Dogecoin is not.

## Highlights

- Jackson Palmer, co-founder of Dogecoin, called Elon Musk a “self-absorbed grifter’s” in an interview with media outlet Crikey.
- Palmer left the Bitcoin industry in 2015 citing its “toxic” atmosphere as the reason.
- The Australian native said Musk lacks the ability to execute basic programming.
- Palmer remains fiercely critical of the industrialist, in stark contrast to Markus' flattering adulation to him.
- Palmer blasted Musk last month for his hostile takeover of Twitter, which he called a 'fraudulent' behavior.
- DogeCoin's market cap at $11.35 billion on the daily chart.
