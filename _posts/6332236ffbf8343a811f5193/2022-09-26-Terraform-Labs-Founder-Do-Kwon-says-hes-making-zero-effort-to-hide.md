Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon seemed to brush off the fact he is wanted by authorities.

## Highlights

- Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon says he's making no effort to hide.
- South Korean officials are seeking the founder-turned-fugitive for allegedly breaking capital market laws.
- He said he is writing code in his living room and that he goes on walks and to malls.
- The founder apologized for any confusion and said he hadn’t issued a “twitter wide invitation” to anyone who wants to visit him, but he said he hasn't issued a Twitter invitation.
- The warrant was issued by a South Korean court on the heels of the collapse of luna and terraUSD, following the $40 billion collapse of both companies.
