If you’ve been in the NFT space for some time, then chances are that you’ve either been the victim of a rug pull or read about one.

## Highlights

- Adult film star Lana Rhoades abandoned her CryptoSis NFT project last week.
- She promised to increase the value of the NFTs but failed to sell out as fast as possible.
- She then took back her promises and took down her Twitter account.
- The adult film star dubbed YouTubers “sickos” and denied the claim of scamming her community.
- NFT's floor price has dropped to 0.01 ETH, which is around $26, a drastic drop from its original mint price of 0.1 ETH ($261) In her defense, she claims she needs to pay out the development team.
