Political recipients that receive donations in crypto would be unable to spend these funds directly or hold them as assets.

## Highlights

- Kansas lawmakers are mulling a new bill that would cap a cap of $100 on crypto donations for use in any primary or general election.
- This cap would be based on the “fair market value” at the time the crypto is received by the payments processor.
- The bill also proposes stricter rules on how crypto can be used by political campaigns in Kansas.
- Political recipients that receive donations in crypto would be unable to spend these funds directly or hold them as assets long-term.
- The proposed rules would only be accepted if they come from a crypto payment processor based in the U.S.
- This processor would then need to employ procedures that allow it “to form a reasonable belief” that the true identity of the contributor is known
