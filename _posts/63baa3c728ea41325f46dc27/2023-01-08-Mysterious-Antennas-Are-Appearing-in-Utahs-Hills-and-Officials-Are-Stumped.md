City officials have found around a dozen of the antennas and no one is sure what they're for.

## Highlights

- Authorities have no idea what they are or who put them up on public lands in Salt Lake City, Utah.
- The antennas are simple machines made up of a LoRa fiberglass antenna, a locked battery pack, and a solar panel to power it.
- The highest elevation one of the antennas had been found at is the top of Mount Wire, which is more than 7,000 feet.
- Other antennas were found on land managed by the University of Utah and the Forest Service.
- One theory is that the antennas are part of a cryptocurrency mining operation that uses antennas to create a long-range, wide-area network of Helium-like networks.
