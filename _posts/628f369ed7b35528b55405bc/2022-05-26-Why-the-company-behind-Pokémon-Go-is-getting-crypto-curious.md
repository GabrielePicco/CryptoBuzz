Niantic CEO John Hanke hints at the Pokémon Go company’s early explorations into incorporating blockchain technologies, and possibly NFTs, into its games.

## Highlights

- John Hanke, CEO of Pokémon Go developer Niantic, was closing out keynote address at its first-ever developer summit.
- Hanke talked about his company’s early explorations around incorporating blockchain technologies into its games.
- The idea behind putting all this on the blockchain, a SpotX Games employee told me, is that the data is hard to fake.
- The company proved with Pokémon Go that it could take a nascent technology like AR and take it massively mainstream, generating an estimated $5 billion in revenue in its first five years.
- In 2000, Google Maps co-founded by Hanke in Silicon Valley, it acquired Keyhole and turned it into Keyhole.
