Hong Kong traders may only be able to trade tokens with the largest market cap, and companies may be forced to close if they don’t meet regulatory requirements.

## Highlights

- Hong Kong's regulator proposes relaxation of rules banning retail investors from buying crypto tokens from licensed platforms on Monday.
- Regulator also announced all crypto trading platforms operating in Hong Kong need to be approved by the Securities and Futures Commission by June 2024.
- The SFC “will not hesitate to take enforcement action,” the regulator suggested in a new consultation.
- The government has been behind changes to the city's crypto licensing rules with officials keen to position Hong Kong as a financial center for digital assets.
- The city's central bank only last week issued the world's first tokenized green bond, raising around $100 million to invest in clean energy technology.
