Paul Tudor Jones has said that the \"intellectual capital\" flooding into the crypto space shows that the asset class has huge promise.

## Highlights

- Jones was among the first Wall Street titans to publicly declare that Bitcoin could have value as an inflationary hedge during the COVID-19 crisis.
- He also said that he sees a “generational divide” between older people and digital natives concerning crypto and Web3.
- Jones has previously revealed that he owns Bitcoin, but he's better known for his experience in traditional finance markets.
- He famously predicted the 1987 Black Monday crash, and his successful market calls have netted him a net worth of about $7 billion.
