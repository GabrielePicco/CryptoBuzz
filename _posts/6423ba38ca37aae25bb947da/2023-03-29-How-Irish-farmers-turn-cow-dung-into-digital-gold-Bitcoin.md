This Irish dairy farmer is proving that his farming techniques can benefit both the environment and his bottom line.

## Highlights

- Tom Campbell, who runs a farm in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, produces renewable energy using a method called anaerobic digestion.
- This involves breaking down biodegradable material to a point where it creates methane gas, which can be used to produce electricity.
- Campbellâ€™s farm produces up to 700 kilowatts of electrical output, equivalent to powering nearly 12,000 households.
- When there is excess energy that cannot be exported to the grid, he uses it to mine Bitcoin.
- Mining involves using specialized computers to solve complex mathematical equations, with successful miners rewarded with BTC.
- With renewable energy sources becoming increasingly popular, more farmers could turn to Bitcoin mining in the future.
