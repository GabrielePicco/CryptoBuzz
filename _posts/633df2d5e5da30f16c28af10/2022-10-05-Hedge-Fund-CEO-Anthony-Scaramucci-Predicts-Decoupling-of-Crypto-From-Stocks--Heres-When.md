Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci says stocks and cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) are bound to decouple from stocks on the back of one critical catalyst.

## Highlights

- Anthony Scaramucci says the Federal Reserve is likely finished raising interest rates.
- The former White House Director of Communications says that there’s a correlation between crypto assets and the main stock indices like the Nasdaq.
- He thinks regulatory clarity from the U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could be a catalyst that makes crypto start to move independently.
- However, last month Bitcoin was down about 3.7% and the overall market was down closer to 10%.
- The Daily Hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets, nor is an investment advisor.
