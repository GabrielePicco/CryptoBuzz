The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) has banned financial institutions from offering unregulated digital assets services. The move comes roughly a month after the International Monetary Fund approved a $45 billion loan facility that required the country to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies. Argentina

## Highlights

- Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) has banned financial institutions from offering unregulated digital assets services.
- The move comes roughly a month after the International Monetary Fund approved a $45 billion loan facility that required the country to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies.
- Since no crypto assets are regulated in the country, the move effectively amounts to a blanket ban on crypto transactions within the official economy.
- The IMF pulled a similar trick with El Salvador in January, ordering it to “narrow the scope of the Bitcoin law by removing Bitcoin’s legal tender status” Unlike Argentina, El Salvador, which was also negotiating a loan deal with the IMF, firmly rejected the conditions.
