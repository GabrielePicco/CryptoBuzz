Even though Web2-based social media platforms have managed to position themselves as an indispensable part of our daily lives, there are some major challenges they haven’t been able to overcome.

## Highlights

- More than half of the global population uses one or more social networking sites.
- There are growing concerns about data privacy and data ownership.
- The existing Web2 social media platforms are heavily centralized.
- Blockchain technology has emerged as the natural solution for these challenges.
- As the technology continues to evolve, incorporating novel features like NFTs, gamification, tokenization, and more, blockchain’s influence on existing social media networks is growing faster than expected.
- By leveraging bits and pieces of blockchain technology, Twitter took the first steps toward building a creator-centric ecosystem.
