- The judge pointed out that the sponsors waded into a highly public criminal case.
- The cryptocurrency mogul's bail package includes a $250 million bond secured by his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, and two additional sponsors who put up a combined $700,000, according to a court filing this month.
- News organizations, including Insider, argued that the public had a right to know who was bankrolling the bail release.
- The decision was made in a New York federal court on Monday.
