If El Salvador succeeds, many countries will follow. If El Salvador somehow fails, which we refuse to, no countries will follow.

## Highlights

- El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender on September 7, 2021.
- President Nayib Bukele stated in an opinion article that, contrary to allegations made by the mainstream media and rating agencies, his country is not collapsing due to its bet on Bitcoin.
- El Salvador is predicted to have acquired 2,381 bitcoins since September 2021 after making eleven Bitcoin acquisitions.
- The final purchase of $BTC occurred on June 30 2022, when El Salvador purchased 80 coins with an average price of $19,000 each.
- The most outspoken opponents terrified and exerting pressure on the country to change its choice are the powerful elites and those who work for or profit from them.
