## Highlights

- Solana’s network usage dropped by 17.6% in Q2 2022.
- Solana-based DeFi protocol, Crema Finance, was exploited, leading to stolen funds of up to $8M last month.
- The latest hack on the Solana network was connected to a private key compromise, as users of Slope and Phantom wallets saw over $7M removed from their wallets in the early hours of August 3.
- SOL is currently trading at $36 at the time of writing, down 13% in the last seven days.
