Bitcoin exchange outflows have hit the surprising level of 106,000 BTC per month.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) moves off exchanges.
- Is it a good sign?
- Bitcoin exchange outflows have hit the surprising level of 106,000 BTC per month.
- The $16,200 levels are acting as the immediate support for BTC, past which the lows from last week of around $15,700 may come into play as a firm support point in the immediate future.
- For now, BTC faces a solid resistance around the $17,600 levels.
- On a positive note, Subway is experimenting upon Bitcoinâ€™s Lightning Network, which is a layer-2 Bitcoin payments solution.
