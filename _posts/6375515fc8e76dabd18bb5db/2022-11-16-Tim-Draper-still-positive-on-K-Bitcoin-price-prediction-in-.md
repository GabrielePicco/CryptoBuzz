Billionaire venture capitalist and serial blockchain investor Tim Draper is not giving up on his bold near-term Bitcoin prediction despite the fall of FTX.

## Highlights

- Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper is not giving up on his near-term Bitcoin price prediction.
- Draper continues to stick with his optimistic prediction that Bitcoin will hit $250,000 in 2023.
- Draper says FTX collapse has nothing to do with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is decentralized.
- Draper also emphasized the importance of self-custody, which comes in line with principles of decentralization.
- The fall of FTX would only trigger more decentralization in crypto as the latest events have once again demonstrated the biggest vulnerabilities of centralization in the crypto industry.
- Not everyone holds the same amount of optimism about Bitcoinâ€™s price in the near future though.
