Vitalik Buterin addresses crowd at ETHDenver Jesse Morgan/ ETHDenver Ethereum will move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake this summer, Vitalik

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin confirms the network will switch to proof-of-stake this summer.
- The move is expected to lower transaction fees and reduce congestion.
- Analysts say the move is bullish for ether, its native token, and should limit supply and activity.
- But DeFi rivals like solana and avalanche blockchains are building on the move, analysts say.
- EIP-1559 hard fork upgrade added a minimum base fee for transactions, calculated by algorithms in response to demand, rather than in an auction, to make it more predictable and reduce the volatility of transaction fees on the network when it is busy, and this should give it a boost.
