Crypto ATMs Return to Tokyo, Osaka for First Time Since 2018. The current system which requires a few days to move funds from an exchange to a local bank account would be sped up by the BTMs.

## Highlights

- Local exchange Coincheck was hacked for $530 million in 2018, bringing the local sector to its knees and diminishing interest in crypto ATMs.
- The government decided to take a hands-off policy and delegate monitoring to the self-regulatory organization Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) The maximum withdrawal amount from the BTMs currently stands at $2,243, or 300,000 Japanese yen, per day, with a per-transaction maximum of $747.
- The company has stated plans to install 50 BTMs across the nation within the following year.
- Within the following three years, the company said it hoped to extend the installed base to 130 BTMs.
