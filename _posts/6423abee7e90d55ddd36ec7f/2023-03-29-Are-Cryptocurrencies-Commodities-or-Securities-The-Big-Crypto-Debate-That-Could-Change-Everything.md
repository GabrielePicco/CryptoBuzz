As the CFTC and SEC diverge over whether cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities, market players feel confusion and want clarity.

## Highlights

- Both the CFTC and SEC view bitcoin as a commodity for now, though though, though.
- The CFTC alleged the firm violated trading and derivative rules, and referred to the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, as commodities.
- The SEC views most crypto assets (aside from Bitcoin) as securities.
- As the SEC and CFTC diverge over whether cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities, market players feel confusion and want clarity.
- As someone who's been covering this space, I can empathize with firms offering crypto trading on this, as it feels wishy-washy.
- Almost like if your mom told you one thing, but your dad told you another.
