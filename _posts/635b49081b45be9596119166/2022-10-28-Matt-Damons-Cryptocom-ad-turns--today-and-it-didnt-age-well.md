Fortune does not favor Crypto.com.

## Highlights

- Matt Damon’s infamous “fortune favors the brave” Crypto.com commercial premiered one year ago today.
- The company reportedly slashed about 40% of its workforce this summer.
- The YouTube version of the Damon commercial has been set to private.
- The price of bitcoin has plunged 70% in a year since the ad debuted.
- Not even the Lakers, which play in the Crypto.com Arena, are cooperating, starting off the NBA season 0–4 with a 0-4 loss against the Lakers.
- Google partially blamed its third-quarter slowdown in revenue growth on advertiser pullback in the crypto space in the third quarter of 2013.
