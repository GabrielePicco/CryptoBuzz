Disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried appears to be living a life of luxury, after pictures of him in an American Airlines lounge and business class seat emerged - following his $250 million bond release.

## Highlights

- Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas last week on a range of fraud and money laundering charges for what prosecutors described as one of the biggest financial crimes in American history.
- The 30-year-old was released on a $250million bond on Thursday after being granted the 'largest pre-trial amount in US history' and 25 times the $10million posted by Bernie Madoff.
- His parents have agreed to put up the equity they own in their $4million California home, where he will live during his house arrest, as part of the bail requirement.
- The FTX founder was seen relaxing at JFK's American Airlines Flagship lounge and without shoes, in business class seat on a AA flight.
