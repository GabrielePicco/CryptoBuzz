Bankrupt CeFi lender Celsius wants to pay back its debts with income from Bitcoin mining.

## Highlights

- Bankrupt CeFi lender Celsius intends to pay back its debts with income from Bitcoin mining.
- Celsius also believes most of its customer deposits actually belong to them.
- It's unclear if Celsius' Bitcoin mining operation will even get online–let alone generate enough income to dig itself out of a $1.2B hole.
- Celsius may not even own this Bitcoin operation by the time it's up and running by the start of the mining operation.
- The same Bitcoin they're planning to mine with rigs stuck in customs inside a building that isn't built yet.
- Celsius' lawyer, Patrick Nash, claims Celsius can use the proceeds from mining Bitcoin to pay its customers.
