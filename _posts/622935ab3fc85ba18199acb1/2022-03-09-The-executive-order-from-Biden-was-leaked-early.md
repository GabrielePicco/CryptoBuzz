The executive order is billed as \"the first ever, whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology.\"

## Highlights

- Executive order from President Joseph Biden scheduled to drop at 6:00 AM EST.
- Order is billed as "first ever, whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology" Statement from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the new executive order seems to have gone up accidentally on the Treasury's website before being taken down, but not before its webarchive was captured.
- It calls on new work from the Treasury, Financial Stability Oversight Council, Federal Reserve and national security agencies on relevant portions of the crypto ecosystem.
- The order is fairly benign, despite early fears of a pending crackdown on crypto.
