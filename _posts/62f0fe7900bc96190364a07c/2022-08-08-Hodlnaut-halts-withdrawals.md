Hodlnaut will be halting withdrawals, token swaps and deposits with immediate effect. Halting withdrawals and token swaps was a necessary step for us to stabilise our liquidity, and give us the time to come up with the best possible restructuring

## Highlights

- To all users, we regret to inform you that we will be halting withdrawals, token swaps and deposits with immediate effect.
- We have reached this difficult decision due to recent market conditions.
- Hodlnaut is therefore no longer providing regulated digital payment token (DPT) services, ie our token swap feature.
- For the avoidance of doubt, Hodlaut will also cease all borrowing and lending services.
- We are working on the recovery plan that we hope to provide updates and details on as soon as permissible.
- Our next update will be on Friday, 19 August 2022.
