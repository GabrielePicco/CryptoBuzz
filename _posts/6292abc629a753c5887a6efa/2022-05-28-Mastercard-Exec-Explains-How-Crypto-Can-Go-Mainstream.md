Mastercard’s VP Product for Digital Assets and Cross Border Payment Innovation says that crypto has to become “invisible” in order to reach mainstream audiences.

## Highlights

- Mastercard’s Harold Bossé says that cryptoassets need to go “invisible” by integrating into existing financial systems.
- Bossé argued that integration, rather than upheaval, was the only realistic path for crypto to achieve mainstream adoption.
- The Mastercard executive predicted that crypto would experience the most growth in areas where businesses are able to embed DeFi into their existing framework.
- He also detailed a number of barriers to crypto adoption, including a lack of knowledge about the industry at a senior management level, the cost and speed of blockchain, and regulatory concerns.
- The VP challenged the crypto community to break out of its bubble and begin attracting demographics that are not currently interested in digital assets.
