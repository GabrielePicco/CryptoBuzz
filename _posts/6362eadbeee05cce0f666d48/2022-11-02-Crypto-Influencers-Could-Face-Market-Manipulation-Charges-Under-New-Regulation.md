The European Union is preparing to deploy MiCA, a raft of sweeping regulations that could severely curtail the crypto industry in the region.

## Highlights

- European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill was finalized in September.
- The EU is preparing to deploy MiCA, a raft of sweeping regulations that could severely curtail the crypto industry in the region.
- The bill covers everything from stablecoins to crypto mining to nonfungible tokens (NFTs) However, there are also clauses buried within it that could affect crypto influencers.
- If they are deemed to profit from the effects of their actions, it will be considered market manipulation in the EU once MiCA is in force.
- MiCA rapporteur Stefan Berger said these regulations are necessary if “Europe wants to be a big player in the crypto game”
