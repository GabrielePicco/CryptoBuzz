Many are former co-workers from quantitative trading firm Jane Street, others SBF met at the MIT, his alma mater. All 10 are, or used to be, paired up in romantic relationships with each other.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried is roommates with the inner circle who ran his now-struggling crypto exchange FTX and trading giant Alameda Research.
- FTX employees say they have been kept in the dark about the events of the past week.
- Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, whose firm played a central role in the company’s collapse – and who, at times, has dated Bankman Fried, according to people familiar with the matter.
- The Wall Street Journal reported FTX got $10 billion of FTX customer money from Alameda, which the WSJ said siphoned it into corporate sibling Alameda.
- The FTX CEO finally addressed employees on Wednesday, writing “I completely understand if you want to step away”
