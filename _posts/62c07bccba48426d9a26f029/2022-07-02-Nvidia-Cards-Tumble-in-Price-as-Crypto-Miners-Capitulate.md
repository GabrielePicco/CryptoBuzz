The price of Nvidia GPUs is tumbling as crypto miners capitulate, with prices on the secondhand market down by as much as 50%.

## Highlights

- The price of Nvidia cards is tumbling as crypto miners capitulate.
- Prices on the secondhand market down by as much as 50%.
- Nvidia shares fell by 15% this week, down from $173.04 on Monday to $145.96 by Friday.
- Miners which had previously espoused ‘diamond hands’ are reversing course, selling tokens at the bottom to cover operating costs or loans that are now past due.
- Some miners, both big and small, have gone further still, selling off the mining equipment itself.
- The fire sale is causing a drop in the value of GPU miners on secondary markets, even as Nvidia’s recommended retail price remains unchanged.
