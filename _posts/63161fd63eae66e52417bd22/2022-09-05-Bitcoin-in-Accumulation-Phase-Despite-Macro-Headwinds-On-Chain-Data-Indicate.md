The data suggest the long-term growth outlook for the oldest cryptocurrency remains bullish, analysts said.

## Highlights

- The Puell Multiple is a tool that measures one-year revenue growth among bitcoin miners.
- It places bitcoin in a green zone for those looking to build long-term exposure to the coin.
- The metric entered the green zone in the last leg of the previous bear market, which preceded weeks of price consolidation and subsequent revival.
- Analysts say the data suggests the growth outlook for the oldest cryptocurrency remains bullish, with a long term outlook for growth, as well as a bullish outlook on the long run of the coin, they say.
