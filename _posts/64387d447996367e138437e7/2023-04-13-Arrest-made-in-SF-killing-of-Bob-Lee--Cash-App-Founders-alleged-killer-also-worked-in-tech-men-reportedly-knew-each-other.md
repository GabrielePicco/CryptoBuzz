Mission Local is told that San Francisco police this morning arrested a suspect, Nima Momeni, in the April 4 killing of tech exec Bob Lee.

## Highlights

- Bob Lee, 43, was stabbed multiple times in downtown San Francisco on April 4.
- Police say he was driving with a man named Nima Momeni in a car registered to the suspect.
- Lee is one of a dozen homicide victims in San Francisco this year, the only killing that has garnered national coverage.
- Lee’s death, however, was packaged in the media and on social media into a highlight reel of recent San Francisco misfortunes and crimes: large groups of young people brawling brawling at Whole Foods, leaving San Franciscans feeling a feeling of a city coming undone.
- The city's violent crime rate is at a near-historic low and is lower than most mid-to-large-sized cities.
