On October 7, 2022, a bitcoin supporter named Jim Blasko explained that he discovered the oldest upload of Bitcoin’s version 0.1 codebase.

## Highlights

- Bitcoiner Jim Blasko revealed on October 7 via a Facebook post that he was able to scrape up the long-lost Bitcoin codebase.
- The codebase was thought to have been lost for more than a decade and with a “little browser hacking” Blaski found the lost version 0.1 raw data and files stored on sourceforge.net.
- The discovery is unique because it is the very first version of Bitcoin presented in an untampered way and it contains all of Satoshi’s personal notations in the early codebase.
- The original codebase can be found on GitHub and can be downloaded from the search engine here and here.
