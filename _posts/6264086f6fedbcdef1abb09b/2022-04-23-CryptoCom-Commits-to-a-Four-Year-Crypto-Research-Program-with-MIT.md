Crypto.com takes on a new role, collaborating with MIT in the Institution’s Digital Currency Initiative to support a global transition to cryptocurrencies.

## Highlights

- Crypto.com announced it has committed to a four-year gift to the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Media Lab.
- The exchange has been on a marketing blitz through advertising and sponsorship deals.
- The platform's native token, Cronos, currently ranks #19 on CoinMarketCap, with a market cap of $12,246m.
- CRO currently sits below the 50-day EMA at $0.4131.
- The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal.
- CRO will need to avoid sub-$0.40 to support a bullish day ahead.
