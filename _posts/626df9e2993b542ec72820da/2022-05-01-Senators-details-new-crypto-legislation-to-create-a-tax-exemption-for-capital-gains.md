Two Senators details new crypto legislation to create tax exemption for capital gains

## Highlights

- Senators Cynthia Lummis (R, WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D, NY) are proposing a tax exemption for up to a certain level of capital gains on cryptocurrencies.
- The bipartisan duo have created a comprehensive bill offering a standard set of definitions for how cryptocurrencies should be regulated.
- The legislation also provides for protecting users on exchanges against losing money in the event of hacks, by looking to the SEC to enforce consumer protection on exchanges.
- The senators feel the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be the best regulatory agency to oversee stablecoins.
- They also donâ€™t want to limit regulation for stablecoins to only be banks, rather they want to offer flexibility.
