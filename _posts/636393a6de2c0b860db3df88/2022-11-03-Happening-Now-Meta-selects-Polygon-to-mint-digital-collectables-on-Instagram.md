Meta has set in an early Christmas mode for digital asset creators. For the first time ever, Meta is empowering creators to mint & sell Polygon-powered

## Highlights

- Instagram is planning to develop a variety of non-fungible token (NFT)-related features that will enable creators to mint, display, and sell NFTs.
- The social media behemoth states that a “limited set” of United States-based creators will be able to test the new capabilities.
- NFT transactions will continue to incur “app store fees,” referencing Apple’s 30% commission on NFT sales.
- The news follows announcements of other new ways for creators to monetize their work on its platforms.
- In May, it was revealed that a wallet connection functionality would be rolled out to chosen creators.
