The brokerage seems to have lost the luster it had a year ago.

## Highlights

- Robinhood shares fell 11.40% to $8.94 after the close.
- The brokerage seems to have lost the luster it had a year ago.
- Robinhood became hugely popular among retail investors buying and selling meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, after COVID-19 hit, forcing governments into unlocking trillions of dollars in cash assistance for the unemployed and struggling businesses.
- But that money has dried up with the full reopening of many countries, ending fiscal and monetary stimulus.
- The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates last month and expects further hikes.
- The company said this week it planned to let go 10% of its workforce.
