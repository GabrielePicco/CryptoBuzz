Nvidia says that \"excess inventory\" is dragging down its balance sheet.

## Highlights

- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company is dealing with "excess inventory" of current-generation graphics cards.
- Nvidia will reduce the number of cards it sells to manufacturers of graphics cards and laptops.
- Nvidia is also selling fewer cards to cryptocurrency miners, both because of falling prices and the switch from mining to mining.
- It's the best time in years to overhaul or replace your gaming desktop for anyone still getting by with older cards and wanting to upgrade.
- People who want the best performance they can get should probably wait for those cards to launch (AMD and Intel are planning new CPU launches soon).
- However, it's the perfect time for anyone to overhaul their gaming desktop.
