NEW YORK (AP) — Fox says it has sold out all of its Super Bowl LVII ad space as of the end of January. The big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles takes place on Sunday.

## Highlights

- Fox says it has sold out all of its Super Bowl LVII ad space as of the end of January.
- Anheuser-Busch remains the biggest advertiser with three minutes of national airtime.
- Last year’s Super Bowl was dubbed the “Crypto Bowl” because four cryptocurrency companies — FTX, Coinbase, Crypto.com and eToro — ran splashy commercials.
- Other big categories advertising include packaged food like Doritos and M&Ms, movie studios and streaming services, automakers and tech companies, said Mark Evans, executive vide president of ad sales for Fox Sports, said a few ads went for more than $7 million for a 30-second spot.
