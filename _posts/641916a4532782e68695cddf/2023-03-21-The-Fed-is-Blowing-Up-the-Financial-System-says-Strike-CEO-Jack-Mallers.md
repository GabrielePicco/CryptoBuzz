Strike CEO Jack Mallers expects a normalized USD inflation rate of 5% to 10% henceforth, thanks to the Federal Reserve.

## Highlights

- Strike CEO Jack Mallers believes Bitcoin is primed to pump following the Federal Reserve’s $300 billion injection into the banking sector last week.
- Mallers predicts that the US dollar is entering a new era of persistently high inflation, which will only benefit Bitcoin.
- The central bank has been attempting to quell persistently low inflation, reaching a high of 9.1% in June, back to its target 2% rate.
- According to Mallers, inflation within the 5-10% range will now be normalized, meaning Bitcoin will appreciate against dollars as more of the latter enters circulation.
- BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said the Fed's new program will usher in “infinite money printing”
