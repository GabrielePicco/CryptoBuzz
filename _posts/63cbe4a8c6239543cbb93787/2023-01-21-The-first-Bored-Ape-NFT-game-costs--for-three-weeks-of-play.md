Speculative frenzy drives $12.8 million in transactions in one day.

## Highlights

- Dookey Dash is a "skill-based mint" game that lets you race through a sewer tunnel.
- Owners of Yuga Labs' "Bored Ape" non-fungible tokens get free access to the game today.
- But some players are already selling a chance to play the time-limited game for thousands of dollars on the secondary market.
- In less than 24 hours, the OpenSea exchange has seen 8,394 ETH (about $12.8 million) in Sewer Pass transactions, with some passes selling for as much as $8,770.
- The game's "The Summoning" starts on February 15, and players who want to get a legal advantage in the game can get a score boost with a higher tier.
