The MicroStrategy CEO told CNBC on Wednesday he's looking for \"clear, bright line definitions\" around a digital security versus a digital currency.

## Highlights

- MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says tighter government crypto regulations would be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.
- Saylor, a prominent advocate for bitcoin, said he's looking for "clear, bright line definitions" around a digital security versus a digital currency.
- The SEC recently objected to Saylor's accounting method that excluded impairment losses related to its bitcoin holdings, analysts at BTIG explained in a recent note.
- The price of bitcoin, known for its volatility, has fallen on hard times recently, trading nearly 50% below its all-time high near $69,000 per unit in November.
- At current prices around $37,400 per coin, that stake was worth $4.7 billion.
