How Long Does It Take to Mine a Bitcoin on Game Boy? A Million Times Faster Than with Pencil and Paper

## Highlights

- A video by YouTuber Thomas ‘stacksmashing’ Roth made the original Game Boy mine Bitcoin.
- The console had only a single-core 4.19 MHz processor and 8 Kbytes of RAM on the board.
- In comparison, some modern miners have 1.7 GHz of clock speed and 16-24 GB of memory.
- A Game Boy is able to calculate 0.8 hashes per second.
- A modern miner works at 100 terahashes per second, which is 120 trillion times faster.
- Ken Shirriff used a pencil and paper to calculate a hash.
