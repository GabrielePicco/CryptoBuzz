The Race: Three Arrows Capital (3AC) Founders Detained in Dubai Airport

## Highlights

- Three Arrows Capital (3AC) founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies were identified and detained by local authorities in Dubai, UAE as they attempted to flee to Switzerland in a private jet.
- Su Zhu had staked over $1.4 billion in the offshore fund due to market turmoil brought about by the (LUNA) and Terra (UST) disaster.
- Liquidation company Teneo, the liquidation company appointed by the British Virgin Islandsâ€™ court, uploaded a 1,000-page long read.
- The long read was taken down the same day, only to be mirrored by those who were quick enough to save it.
- The now insolvent 3AC has $3.5B of debt according to affidavits.
