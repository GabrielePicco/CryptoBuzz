The tale of the teenage Bitcoin millionaire is fascinating. When he was 12 years old (in 2011), his grandmother gave him a gift of $1,000. Back then, a single Bitcoin was only worth $12, so he bought as much as he could and decided to hold them.

## Highlights

- Erik Finman, the teenage Bitcoin millionaire, is only 19, but he's parlayed his initial Bitcoin investment into millions of dollars.
- He plans on building the “world’s best university” in the city of Dubai.
- His family already runs online teaching training in Dubai, using the technology he developed through his Botangle project.
- Finman now owns 401 bitcoins, which is worth $4.9 million currently.
- His whole family is involved in the project, and Finman chose Dubai because it already has the tallest building, the biggest malls – and I think it deserves to have the best education system in the world too.
