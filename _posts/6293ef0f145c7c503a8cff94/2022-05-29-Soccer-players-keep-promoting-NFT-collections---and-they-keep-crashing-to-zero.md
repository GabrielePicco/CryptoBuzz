90% of Liverpool's \"Heroes Club\" NFTs went unsold, while high-profile players like Paul Pogba and John Terry have backed projects that flopped.

## Highlights

- Liverpool FC launched a series of NFTs two months ago and 90% went unsold.
- The NFT market surged to $41 billion last year, with traditional auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's entering the sector.
- Supporters' groups have criticized teams and players for promoting the unregulated assets.
- John Terry's "Ape Kids Football Club" NFT collection crashed 90% in a single month and can now be bought for $0.019 ETH, or $34, on OpenSea.
- Michael Owen, Paul Pogba and John Terry also endorsed projects that flopped amid the crypto sell-off.
- But some high-profile players have already endorsed digital art, with similarly disastrous results.
