And that’s just for the beta version's waitlist.

## Highlights

- Bluesky wants to build a "social internet" and help users avoid data silos that most commonly exist across internet applications.
- The app is built on a decentralized social media protocol called the Authenticated Transport Protocol, or ‘AT’ It's aimed at making social media open source and interoperable, allowing users to interact with different applications, all within one ecosystem.
- And that’s just for the beta version's waitlist:    Bluesky is building on a social network app that lets users interact with other applications, such as Facebook, Twitter and other social networks.
- Bluesky hopes to release the app in the next month.
