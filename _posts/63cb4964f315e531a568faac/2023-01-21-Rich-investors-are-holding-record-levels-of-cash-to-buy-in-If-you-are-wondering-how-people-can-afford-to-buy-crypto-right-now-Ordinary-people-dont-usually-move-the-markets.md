Investor cash holdings are near record highs, and that could be good news for stocks since there is a wall of money ready to come right back into the market.

## Highlights

- Total net assets in money market funds rose to $4.814 trillion in the week ended Jan.
- 4.
- That eclipses the prior peak of $4.79 trillion during May 2020, back in the earlier months of Covid-19.
- Money market funds are actually generating a few percentage points of income for the first time in years.
- Investors may be finding a safer way to generate some return while they wait for the right moment to invest.
- If the selling continues, they'll park more money into the money market fund, analysts say.
