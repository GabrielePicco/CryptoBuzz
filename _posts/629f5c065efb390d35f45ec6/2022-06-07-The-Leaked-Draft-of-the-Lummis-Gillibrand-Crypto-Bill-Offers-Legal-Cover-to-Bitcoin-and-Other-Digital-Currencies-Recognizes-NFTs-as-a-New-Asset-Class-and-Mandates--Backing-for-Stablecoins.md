The latest leaked draft of the Lummis-Gillibrand bill bodes well for the proponents of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies

## Highlights

- The latest leaked draft of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Bill bodes well for the proponents of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
- The bill seeks to introduce a number of major changes while also providing legal cover to the crypto sphere.
- It appears that the CFTC and not the SEC would act as the primary regulator of the entire crypto industry.
- The legislation will not ban non-custodial or self-hosted crypto wallets.
- Additional pertinent legislation is expected to materialize later this year which would try to regulate the broader Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space along with NFTs.
