The ongoing bear market makes it very difficult for crypto projects to stay afloat as they lose funding.

## Highlights

- Over 12,000 Cryptocurrencies Have One Month of No Trading Volume in 2022.
- The ongoing bear market makes it very difficult for crypto projects to stay afloat as they lose funding.
- The number of new tokens increased sharply following 2021â€™s bull run, which sent Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to new all-time highs.
- But 2022 has been all but positive for the crypto space as rampant inflation and a tough macroeconomic environment drove investors away from cryptocurrencies and other high-risk investments.
- Also, many new crypto startups have adopted a much more risk-averse approach, holding more widely adopted crypto assets like Ether or even cash as a backup.
