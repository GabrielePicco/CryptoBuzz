Wells Fargo has reportedly caused billions of dollars in harm to its customers but has it been overshadowed by the FTX blow-up story?

## Highlights

- The collapse of FTX warrants every bit of attention that it has garnered so far.
- But the ‘world’ may have been more fixated on the damage done by FTX, while billion-dollar scandals by traditional giants such as Wells Fargo do not receive the necessary attention.
- Wells Fargo has reportedly caused billions of dollars in harm to its customers but has it been overshadowed by the FTX blow-up story?
- Some XRP enthusiasts even blamed the SEC for its failure to go after the likes of FTx (that established itself as a political megadonor) and Wells Fargo to protect customers from losing billions and instead pick easy targets like the blockchain firm Ripple.
