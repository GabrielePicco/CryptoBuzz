The groups received about $1 million from the crypto executive, one of numerous political groups he showered with donations.

## Highlights

- The three major Democratic campaign groups say they will set aside more than $2 million they received from Sam Bankman-Fried.
- They'll eventually seek to return the money to the FTX founder's customers.
- The announcement comes days after he was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with violating campaign finance laws.
- A federal prosecutor described the matter as “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history’s history” Other political organizations have not yet said how they will proceed after accepting the FTF founder's generous contributions during the 2022 election cycle.
- The decision adds to the pressure on a wide variety of other political organizations, many of which have yet to say how they'll proceed.
