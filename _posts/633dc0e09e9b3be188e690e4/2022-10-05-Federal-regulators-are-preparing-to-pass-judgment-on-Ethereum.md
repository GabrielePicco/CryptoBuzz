The Securities and Exchange Commission is moving to take action against Ethereum that reaches far beyond America’s borders.

## Highlights

- The Securities and Exchange Commission has gone on a crypto-regulatory spree in September.
- Bitcoin and Ether were declared not a security in the eyes of the SEC in the past.
- The SEC suggested that all transactions occurring on the Ethereum blockchain could fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction because more of its nodes are located in the U.S.
- More likely, this is a negotiating tactic meant to scare the industry into voluntarily succumbing to the SEC's jurisdiction, says Andrew Hammond.
- Hammond: The agency may be trying to take down Bitcoin, but it's unlikely to pass legal muster against all crypto-lending platforms in the United States or any foreign actors.
