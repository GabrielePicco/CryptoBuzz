The market maker for Optimism’s native OP token lost 20 million tokens after it discovered it didn’t have access to its contract on the layer-2 scaling solution. The hacker has so far sold 1 million.

## Highlights

- 20 million OP tokens were stolen by an exploit in Optimism’s smart contract.
- Market maker Wintermute took full responsibility for the incident and offered to accept the attack as a white hat exploit if the hacker agreed to return 19 million tokens within one week.
- The remaining tokens are dormant for now but could be sold at any time or used to sway governance decisions.
- The Optimism layer-2 scaling solution has been hit hard by an attack on a layer-1 (L1) blockchain such as Ethereum.
- Optimism's token price is down 31% at 31% over the past 24 hours according to Coincko Coincko.
- The firm says it will perform buybacks equal to the amount the exploiter sells
