Solana’s premiere non-profit held major exposure to FTT and SRM tokens within the now-insolvent exchange.

## Highlights

- The Solana Foundation has released a fact sheet detailing the exposure it holds to FTX following its bankruptcy.
- The organization held over $180 million worth of crypto asset exposure to the company as of November 6th.
- The non-profit said these funds were “negligible” to its operations, accounting for less than 1% of its cash reserves.
- Solana also held 3.24 million shares of FTX common stock.
- FTX (FTT) tokens and 134.54 million Serum (SRM) tokens are now trapped on the Solana exchange.
- Since FTX’s collapse, FTT has fallen to just $1.32, while SRM trades for $0.32.
