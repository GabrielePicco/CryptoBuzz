Many major cryptocurrency exchanges put forth defiant statements this week when Ukraine asked them to freeze any accounts belonging to Russians, with some

- Some exchanges called upon cryptoâ€™s history of libertarian ideals to back up their decisions.
- But many were complying with the sanctions plan aimed at devastating the Russian economy.
- The gap between the words and actions of crypto's biggest players points to the challenges that the crypto community now faces as a mainstream industry in the midst of a geopolitical and humanitarian crisis.
- Critics say virtual currency has little practical value aside from money laundering and investment hedging while requiring huge amounts of electricity and the burning of fossil fuels.
- Critics are concerned that making crypto into big business means accepting things like international sanctions.
