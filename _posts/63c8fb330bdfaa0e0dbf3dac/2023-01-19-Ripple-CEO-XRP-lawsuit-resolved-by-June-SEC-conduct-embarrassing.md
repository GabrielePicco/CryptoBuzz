Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes its ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) will reach an outcome soon, adding that a settlement with the “embarrassing” SEC is unlikely.

## Highlights

- Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expects the firm’s long-running dispute with the U.S.
- Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) will be finalized within “single-digit months” and a verdict could come as soon as June, he said.
- The lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December 2020, claiming that Ripple illegally sold its XRP token as an unregistered security.
- The firm has long disputed the claim, arguing that it doesn’t constitute an investment contract under the Howey test under the terms of the SEC, arguing the token is not a security.
- Garlinghead also said the SEC should take note of some of the more crypto-friendly countries that are piecing together more “positive” regulation.
