One way for analyzing dormant Bitcoins has been to classify them according to how long they have been idle.

## Highlights

- The bulk of Bitcoins has not been transferred in at least a year, according to on-chain data.
- Despite Bitcoinâ€™s terrible performance, crypto investors are clinging to their BTC.
- At the time of writing, more than 60% of all Bitcoins had not moved in the previous year.
- Short-term trends appear to be unimportant for the vast majority of Bitcoins in circulation.
- Smaller investors, on the other hand, have halted their accumulation efforts in the last week.
- The asset was trading at $40,103.85, down 0.27 percent in 24 hours.
