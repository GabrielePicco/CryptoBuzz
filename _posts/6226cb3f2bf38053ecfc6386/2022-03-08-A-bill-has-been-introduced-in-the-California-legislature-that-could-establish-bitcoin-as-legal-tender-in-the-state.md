California could be the first state to accept bitcoin as legal tender, but it may mean going up against the US Constitution.

## Highlights

- A bill has been introduced in the California legislature that could establish bitcoin as legal tender in the state.
- It is not the first time a state has introduced such a measure, and a constitutional amendment might be needed before it is passed.
- Some businesses in California and across the US currently accept bitcoin or other digital assets as a means of payment.
- The bill will also serve to clear up issues around taxing cryptocurrencies, which may slow crypto adoption, bitcoin advocate Dennis Porter said, but seeing the bill pass is still the goal, but people want certainty about what they canâ€™t do and what they want, he said.
- In January, Arizona State Sen.
- Wendy Rogers introduced a bill that would legalize bitcoin.
