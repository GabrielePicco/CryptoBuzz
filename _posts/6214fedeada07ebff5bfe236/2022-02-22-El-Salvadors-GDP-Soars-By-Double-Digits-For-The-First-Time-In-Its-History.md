The data is in and El Salvador’s president is beaming ear to ear as his Bitcoin venture has earned impressive results. For the first time

## Highlights

- El Salvador’s GDP grew by over 10% in 2021 which is a first for the small country.
- The President thinks the country is on course to break an even bigger milestone in 2022.
- A combination of shrewd economic policies and daring leaps like the Bitcoin adoption may account for the reversal of fortunes.
- Other countries in similar economic travails like El Salvador might be tempted to steal a page from its book and make the big leap to Bitcoin adoption in the wake of the country's economic resurgence.
- The country’�s Bitcoin adoption was not a walk-in-the-park as the government faced stiff opposition from a section of its citizenry and international organizations.
