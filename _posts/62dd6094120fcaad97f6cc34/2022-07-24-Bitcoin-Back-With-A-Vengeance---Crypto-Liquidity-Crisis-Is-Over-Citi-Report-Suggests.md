Bitcoin could be getting the kick out of the sea of green flashing on most crypto exchanges' screens these days. The proverbial massive ice in the crypto

## Highlights

- Multiple indicators show that the liquidity crisis in the broader cryptocurrency markets may have seen the worst.
- This is the conclusion suggested by Citi Bank, in its latest study.
- Citi believes crypto markets are too small and relatively isolated to create a ripple effect on the financial sector or the economy as a whole, but they can nevertheless influence investor mood.
- At $990 billion compared to the US share marketâ€™s $34 trillion, crypto remains too small to significantly impact financial markets, Citi's analysis pointed out.
- The bank's assessment indicates that fears of contagion have likely reached its pinnacle, at least temporarily.
- Bitcoin is currently trading at $22,774.66, up 8% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show.
