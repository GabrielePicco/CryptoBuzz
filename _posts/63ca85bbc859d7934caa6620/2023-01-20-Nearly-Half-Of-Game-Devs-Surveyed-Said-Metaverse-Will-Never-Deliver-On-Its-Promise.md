Fortnite is in the lead over Horizon Worlds and Minecraft, but nobody felt like the metaverse was around the corner.

## Highlights

- GDCâ€™s latest State of the Game Industry survey points to an interest in the latest iterations of VR hardware.
- However, 45 percent of respondents said that there are no games or companies that will give us a metaverse.
- Fortnite is in the lead over Horizon Worlds and Minecraft, but nobody felt like the metaverse was around the corner.
- VR hardware is still too expensive and limiting, and game devs are worried about monetizing the massive costs of a persistent virtual world in an era where players are already tired of loot boxes and battle passes.
- There's still plenty of interest for VR gaming, with 36 percent of VR game devs saying they plan to release their next game on the Meta Quest.
