Crypto winter has taken crypto noobies by storm of ice as a lot of them are panicking & opting out as the market crashes.

## Highlights

- Bank of America report a 50% drop in active crypto users between its peak of one million in November and just 500,000 users in May.
- The bank referenced internal statistics, claiming that the downturn began long before the June selloff.
- Bitcoin fell more than 70% from it’s all-time highs in November, trading at just under $20,000.
- A recent survey of the U.S.
- general population found that sentiment towards cryptocurrencies soured between April and June, with a rise from 21% to 30% in those saying they haven’t invested and have no plans to do so.
- “Relatively few people view crypto assets as a reliable long-term investment.”
