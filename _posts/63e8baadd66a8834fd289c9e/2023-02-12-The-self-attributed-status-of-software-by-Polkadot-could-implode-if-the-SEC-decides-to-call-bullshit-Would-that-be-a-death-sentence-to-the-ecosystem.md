There is a lot of debate on whether cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. Opinions on that front are divided.

## Highlights

- Polkadot (DOT) Argues it is Not A Security But Software.
- There is a lot of debate on whether cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.
- The Web3 Foundation and SEC have taken steps to rebuke doubt over DOT being a security.
- DOT is used for network governance, staking, and bonding.
- The self-certification is not an official ruling, but it confirms the team’s commitment to providing clarity to the project and potentially creates a precedent for other assets that might fall under the “security” label today.
- A resolution of the matter remains up in the air, but the progress by Schoenberger confirms initial securities can evolve into something else.
