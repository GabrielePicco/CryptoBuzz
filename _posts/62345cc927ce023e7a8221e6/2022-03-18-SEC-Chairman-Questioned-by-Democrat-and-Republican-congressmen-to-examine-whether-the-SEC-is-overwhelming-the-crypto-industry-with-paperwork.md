A group of both Democrat and Republican congressmen is examining whether the SEC is overwhelming the crypto industry with paperwork.

## Highlights

- Seven congressmen sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler with critical questions about the authority’s crypto industry reporting requirements.
- The letter suggests that the SEC has been inappropriately using its investigative powers in violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act.
- The act requires federal agencies to be ‘good stewards of the public’�s time’ and “not overwhelm them with unnecessary or duplicative requests for information” The letter was co-signed by seven other congressmen spanning across party lines.
- It also asks if there is a limit to the number of related requests the SEC can make per year, and if it has conducted a cost-benefit analysis on its requests.
