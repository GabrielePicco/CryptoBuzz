The digital bank will continue serving its current 20 million users while giving access to bitcoin and crypto services to 17 million users across the EEA.

## Highlights

- Digital bank Revolut has received approval to offer bitcoin and crypto services to 17 million customers in the EEA.
- The bank will continue to offer services in the U.K.
- and service its existing 20 million users.
- The approval comes ahead of the pending Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law which seeks to ensure greater consumer protections in Europe while combating money laundering and fraud.
- However, this particular framework for digital assets has yet to be put into a full text.
- With a new legal framework pending, institutions like Revoluts will need to take necessary steps to become regulated within the current purview of the current legal framework of MiCA while possibly experiencing further scrutiny.
