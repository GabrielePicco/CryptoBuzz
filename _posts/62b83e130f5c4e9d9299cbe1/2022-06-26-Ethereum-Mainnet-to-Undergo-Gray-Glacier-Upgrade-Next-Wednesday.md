Next Wednesday, June 29, the Ethereum network will undergo a scheduled upgrade called “Gray Glacier” at block 15,050,000.

## Highlights

- The Ethereum network will undergo a scheduled upgrade at block 15,050,000.
- The upgrade will prolong the Difficulty Bomb by 100 days.
- The Difficulty Bomb is to disincentivize miners to stop mining on the current network.
- Developers are confident and planning on running the merge on their second major testnet, Sepolia, around July 6, after the July 4 long weekend in the US.
- To be compatible with the Gray Glacier upgrade, node operators need to update the client version they run to one of the ones listed here.
- Developers discussed merge testing-related items with a debrief on how the 7th mainnet shadow fork went poorly.
