The value of Bitcoin has slid significantly, and is now hovering at a two-year low, following the news of Binance offering to bail out FTX.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin has slid nearly ten percent over the past 24 hours, now hovering at a two-year low.
- FTX, the largest exchange by trading volume, has offered to bail out rival exchange FTX.
- The news has clearly rattled the entire cryptocurrency industry, with the value of Bitcoin now at $17,000.
- Other tokens such as Ether are also in free fall right now, signifying a major downturn.
- The collapse is still ongoing as of Wednesday morning, with major tokens stumbling even further, suggesting a prolonged period of uncertainty in the market.
- The chaos underlines the tech's seemingly inherent volatility â€” and the fact that even holding on to your investments for years isn't always guaranteed to pay off.
