Despite huge losses in the first half of the year, crypto enthusiasts refuse to give up hope in this alternative asset.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, down to about one-third of that value.
- Celebrities like Kevin O’Leary, Edward Snowden, Snoop Dogg and Mike Tyson are still putting their faith in crypto.
- Some analysts say it’s just a correction for this speculative and volatile asset, while others are much more damning, likening it to a house of cards built on an unsteady foundation.
- Some experts aren’t so sure what we’ll find when the ash clears, but some experts say this crypto winter different from previous downturns is that its speculative nature isn't completely to blame.
