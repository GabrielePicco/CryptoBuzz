Yes, you read that right, and you‚Äôre not limited t...

## Highlights

- The team behind this work, Spectra, is one I‚Äôve worked with as a community moderator for quite some time.
- Spectra started off as an NFT art team with a knack for using the blockchain to generate their images.
- Using on-chain data to render images is cool and all, but it can be costly and it took them a ton of processing and man power to get the images rendered.
- They fixed these problems by implementing logical processing layer called the EVM on the blockchain.
- This is Turing complete and allows trustless decisions to be made using pieces of code known as Smart Contracts.
- This allows us to get basic images drawn on screen, but you wouldn‚Äôt really be able to tell they are 3D without the right lighting?
