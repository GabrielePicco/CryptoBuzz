Defining the standard for blockchain technology with the first-of-its-kind pure proof-of-stake protocol built to support the scale, open participation, and transaction finality for billions of users

## Highlights

- Algorand is the technology company powering the platform for next-generation blockchain-based applications.
- Smart contract compatibility with contract to contract calls allows complex dApps to be built that can efficiently and trustlessly interact with other smart contract based dApps.
- Post-quantum secure Falcon Keys are Algoranâ€™s first major milestone on its path towards trustless cross-chain interoperability.
- These keys will, in the near future, be used to generate State Proofs, a new blockchain infrastructure that will allow Algoron to be trustlessly accessed in low-power environments like mobile phones, smart watches, and on other blockchains.
