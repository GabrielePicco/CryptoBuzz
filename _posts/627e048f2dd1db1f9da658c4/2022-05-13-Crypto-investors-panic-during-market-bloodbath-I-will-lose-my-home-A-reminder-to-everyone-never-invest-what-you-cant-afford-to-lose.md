Crypto investors panicked as bitcoin and other digital coins continued to plummet. Titans who run leading marketplaces such as Coinbase and Binance were affected.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin plunges to its lowest price in more than a year and other cryptocurrencies suffer even worse sell-offs.
- Victims range from billionaire crypto titans to lowly retail investors who have poured their life savings into cryptocurrencies.
- Bitcoin was trading around $28,300 Thursday afternoon, down 20% over the past week and nearly 60% lower than its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021.
- The entire cryptocurrency market now has a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion — less than half of the $2.9 trillion it was worth in November, according to CoinMarketCap data.
- “In crypto, the strong survive and the weak get flushed” said Garrick Hileman, research chief at Blockchain.com.
