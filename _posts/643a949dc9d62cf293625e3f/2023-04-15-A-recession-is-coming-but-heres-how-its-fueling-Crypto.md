Macro Markets Ep # 8 on Cointelegraph Markets & Research: Marcel Pechman explains how a potential looming recession might be causing Bitcoin’s price to rise.

## Highlights

- Marcel Pechman explains how the U.S.’s record-low unemployment rate could be hiding a bigger issue caused by inflation.
- The S&P 500 being only 13% below its all-time high has been driven by investors moving away from fixed income and why inflation is no longer a primary concern.
- Pechmen also discusses the link between the banking crisis, a weaker dollar and Bitcoin's recent rally above $30,000.
