The Senate is expected to consider the legislation later Monday.

## Highlights

- Florida House votes to clarify state law and financial regulations regarding cryptocurrency.
- The bill would undo a 2019 court ruling preventing individuals who own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from selling them without a license.
- The Senate is ready to pass the proposal and is expected to consider the House bill later Monday.
- The legislation would clarify that only intermediaries, such as a platform that enables cryptocurrency transactions, require a money transmitter license.
- The change would make clear that individuals seeking to sell cryptocurrency are not subject to licensure requirements.
- The measure would better define cryptocurrency to open clearer regulation from state officials down the line, according to Rep.
