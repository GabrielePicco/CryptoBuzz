Crypto firm Voyager Digital Ltd said on Monday it will sell its assets to Binance.US in a deal valued at about $1 billion following a review.

## Highlights

- Crypto firm Voyager Digital Ltd said on Monday it will sell its assets to Binance.US in a deal valued at about $1 billion following a review.
- Nearly $2 trillion in value has been wiped out from the crypto sector this year on rising interest rates and exacerbating worries of an economic downturn.
- However, the bigger blow came after larger crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection last month.
- Voyager Digital said FTX won an auction for its assets in a bid valued at $1.42 billion after Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.
- The collapse has fanned fears about the future of the crypto industry after FTX outlined a "severe liquidity crisis".
