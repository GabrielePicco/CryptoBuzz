A fake Ledger app on the Microsoft App Store has stolen 16.8+ BTC, worth around $588k. The scammer has managed to steal the money through a fake Ledgers app.

## Highlights

- A fake Ledger app on the Microsoft App Store has stolen 16.8+ BTC, worth around $588k.
- The scammer has managed to steal the money through an app that asks you to enter a 12-24 word recovery phrase into the desktop app.
- The hacker's wallet address can be tracked down to a well-known crypto sleuth — ZachXBT (we recommend giving him a follow on Twitter!).
- Always remember: Ledger, Trezor, or any decent hardware wallet will not ask you.
- Only enter your 12- 24 word.
- recovery phrase on the hardware wallet device itself, when doing wallet recoveries.
