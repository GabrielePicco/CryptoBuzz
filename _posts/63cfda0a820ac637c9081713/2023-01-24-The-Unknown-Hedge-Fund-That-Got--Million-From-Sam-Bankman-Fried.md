After the collapse of FTX, prosecutors and lawyers have scrutinized its discredited founder’s huge investment in Modulo Capital.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors are examining whether Sam Bankman-Fried used FTX’s customer funds to invest in the little-known firm when his existing hedge fund was struggling amid a wider crypto industry downturn.
- Modulo Capital is emerging as a crucial part of the investigation by federal prosecutors into the collapse of FTX.
- The $400 million outlay was one of Mr.
- Bankman's single largest investments.
- At the same time, lawyers for FTX's new leadership are eyeing Modulo's assets as they scramble to recover the billions of dollars that customers, lenders and investors lost when the exchange imploded.
