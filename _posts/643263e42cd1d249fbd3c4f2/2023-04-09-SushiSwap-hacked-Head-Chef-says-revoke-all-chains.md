The exploit involves the RouterProcessor2 contract — which PeckShield and SushiSwap Head Chef Jared Grey recommend revoking on all chains.

## Highlights

- Decentralized exchange SushiSwap has fallen victim to an exploit, which led to the loss of more than $3.3 million from at least one user.
- The exploit involves an approve-related bug on the RouterProcessor2 contract.
- Sushi is "working with security teams to mitigate the issue," head chef Jared Grey tweeted.
- The price of Sushi's governance token fell by only 0.6% in the hour since the news broke.
- The bug allows an unauthorized entity to essentially "yoink" tokens without the proper approval from the token owner.
- More than 2000 addresses on Layer 2 Arbitrum have seemingly approved the bad contract.
