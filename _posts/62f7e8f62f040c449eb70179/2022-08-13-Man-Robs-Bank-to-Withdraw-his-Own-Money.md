A man has been hailed as a national hero after he robbed a bank to get his own money back

## Highlights

- Lebanese man held hostages hostage in a Beirut bank and threatened to set himself on fire if staff wouldn't allow him to withdraw his own money.
- Bassam al-Sheikh Hussein, 42, had around Â£171,000 in his account which he needed to pay for his father's medical bills.
- Nobody was injured during the siege, which ended after Hussein was allowed to withdraw a chunk of his savings just as he'd wanted to do all along.
- Protesters gathered outside the bank chanting 'down with the rule of the banks' and later shouted that Hussein was a Lebanese national hero for going to such drastic levels to access his own cash.
- Lebanon is suffering through its worst economic crisis in modern history following a financial collapse.
