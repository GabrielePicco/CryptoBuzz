# Having a safe CEX: proof of solvency and beyond  _Special thanks to Balaji Srinivasan, and Coinbas

## Highlights

- Bitcoin exchange MtGox moved 424242 BTC to a pre-announced address in 2011.
- The earliest attempts by exchanges to try to cryptographically prove that they are not cheating their users go back quite far.
- If you prove that customers' deposits equal X, and prove ownership of the private keys of X coins, then you have a **proof of solvency**: you've proven the exchange has the funds to pay back all of its depositors.
- This post will get into the history of attempts to move exchanges one or two steps closer to trustlessness, and some newer and more powerful ideas that rely on [ZK-SNARKs and other advanced technologies.
