Jack Dorsey's digital payments firm Block invests in an East African bitcoin miner that uses wasted energy.

## Highlights

- Africa has an estimated 10 terawatts of solar capacity, 350 gigawatts of hydro, 110 GW of wind, according to data from Energy, Capital & Power.
- Bitcoin miners are essentially energy buyers, and when they co-locate with renewables, it creates a financial incentive for buildout.
- Jack Dorsey's digital payments firm Block and Alyse Killeen's bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark have led a $2 million seed investment into the company, which Gridless says it plans to use to open new mines in other parts of Africa with the help of a fresh injection of cash.
- Gridless currently has three operational pilot sites in Kenya, one 90-minute drive from Nairobi.
