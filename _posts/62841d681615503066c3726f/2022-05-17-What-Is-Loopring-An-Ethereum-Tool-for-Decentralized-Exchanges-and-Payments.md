Loopring protocol provides Ethereum developers the tools they need to build their own decentralized exchanges.

## Highlights

- Loopring seeks to make trading assets and making payments on the mainchain faster and cheaper.
- It is a layer-2 protocol that utilizes a cryptographic technology called zkRollups.
- Loopring is a protocol for building non-custodial, orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Ethereum.
- It routes and processes trades, matching sellers and buyers at a market price without ever requiring possession of the buyers’ or sellers’ funds.
- The experience of trading on a Loopring-powered DEX is more akin to trading on centralized exchanges.
- It can process 200 trades/transactions per second, roughly 10x what its own can do its own.
