Gemini, the crypto exchange controlled by the Winklevoss twins, will contribute $100 million in cash to a recovery plan for bankrupt crypto lender Genesis.

## Highlights

- Gemini and parent Digital Currency Group agreed to a restructuring deal with bankrupt Genesis Global Capital.
- Gemini will contribute up to $100 million in cash to a recovery plan for bankrupt crypto lender Genesis.
- The deal is largely predicated around a refinancing of Genesis' loans to DCG.
- Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss twins, had been engaged in a high-profile back-and-forth with Barry Silbert, who owns the parent company of Genesis Global.
- Silbert and Gemini have publicly blamed Silbert's mismanagement of Genesis for issues with one of its own products called Earn, which promoted returns of up to 8% on customer deposits.
