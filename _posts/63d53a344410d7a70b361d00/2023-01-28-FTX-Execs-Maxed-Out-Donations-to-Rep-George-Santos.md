FEC filings have revealed that the New York congressman, under fire for a plethora of lies, was a favorite candidate among FTX leadership.

## Highlights

- Ex-FTX executives maxed out donations to George Santos (R-NY) during his successful 2022 campaign for Congress, FEC filings have revealed.
- Ryan Salame, FTX’s co-CEO, Claire Watanabe, and Ramnik Arora all donated the maximum possible amount to Santos’ campaign permitted under federal law during the summer of 2022.
- Salame is a prolific political donor who shelled out millions to congressional candidates of both major political parties during the 2022 election cycle.
- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested last month for eight criminal charges, including fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and campaign finance violations.
