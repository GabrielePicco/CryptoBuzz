## Highlights

- FTX's Super Bowl commercial features Larry David as the skeptic during landmark inventions throughout time.
- This is actually David's first commercial, and director Jeff Schaffer said that FTX "had the grapes to make an ad where Larry David says he won't use the product" While the ad for the Super Bowl is 60 seconds, there's a two and a half minute trailer that will be released online later tonight.
- "A lot of people who are now the biggest advocates of crypto once had significant reservations," said FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman.
- "Who better to belittle the sum of human achievement â€“ and be wrong?"
- said Schaffer.
