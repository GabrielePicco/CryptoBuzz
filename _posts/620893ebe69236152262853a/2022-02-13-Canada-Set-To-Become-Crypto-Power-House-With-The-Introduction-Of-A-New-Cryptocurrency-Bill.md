A Canadian MP has proposed a bill that would encourage growth in the crypto industry. The bill passed its first reading this week.

## Highlights

- Bill C-249 has passed its first reading and hopes to encourage crypto growth in Canada.
- The bill would require members of parliament to interface with industry leaders in order to create suitable regulations.
- Canada was the first country on the continent to approve Bitcoin-backed ETF products, and it appears they want to maintain their status as pioneers in the field.
- It follows a year where many industry experts have decried the lack of clear regulations and the unwillingness of the SEC to approve crypto products that are already approved in other countries, like Canada and the US, to regulate the crypto market.
- Several market participants have received the bill positively and recognize its potential to make Canada an industry leader.
