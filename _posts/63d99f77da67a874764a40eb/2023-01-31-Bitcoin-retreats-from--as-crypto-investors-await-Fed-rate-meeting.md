Bitcoin withdrew from a weekend high of close to $24,000, falling into the mid $23,000 zone as crypto investors cautiously await this week's US Federal Reserve interest rate meeting.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin withdraws from a weekend high of close to $24,000, falling into the mid $23,000 zone.
- The market is poised in expectation that the US central bank will lift rates by 25 basis points.
- The expected 25-basis point rate hike by the Fed is seen as a positive sign, fuelling January's surge in risk assets.
- Despite conflicting economic data and disappointing earnings reports, the market has remained buoyant due to favourable inflation news.
- The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed higher on Friday, reaching its highest level in two months.
