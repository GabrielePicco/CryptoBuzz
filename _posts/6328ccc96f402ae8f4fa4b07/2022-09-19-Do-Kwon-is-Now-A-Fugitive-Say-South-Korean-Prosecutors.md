Do Kwon has been labeled a fugitive by South Korean prosecutors. However, Do Kwon has refuted the claims saying he is not on the run.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon, CEO of troubled Terraform Labs, has been labeled a fugitive by South Korean prosecutors.
- South Korean authorities had a warrant issued for his arrest last week.
- The arrest warrant was issued for fear that the suspect would not comply with the request for an appearance.
- Kwon has refuted the claims saying he is not on the run and did not have anything to hide.
- The Terra Luna cryptocurrency plunged in May following the de-pegging of the TerraUSD stablecoin, with around $60 billion worth of funds lost following the collapse.
- The collapse shook the crypto industry, and a ripple effect caused several projects that had invested in LUNA, such as Three Arrows Capital, to fall.
