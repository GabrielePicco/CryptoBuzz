Contract Proxy implements a fallback function that delegates all calls to the address returned by the abstract _implementation() internal function. It will return to the external caller whatever the implementation returns. This is a low level function that doesn't return

## Highlights

- Contract Proxy delegates all calls to the address returned by the abstract _implementation() internal function.
- The fallback function delegates execution to an implementation contract.
- This is a low level function that doesn't return to its internal call site.
- It will return to the external caller whatever the implementation returns.
- The current contract implements a proxy that allows to change the implementation address to which it will delegate.
- Contract UpgradeabilityProxy is Proxy, which delegates the address of the current implementation.
