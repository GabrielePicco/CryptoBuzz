title:  "Someone steals the Bored Ape belonging to former football star Dez Bryant"
description: "The latest ape escape has affected Dez Bryant, a former NFL player now turned \"web3 innovator\". Bryant was the proud owner of Bored Ape #2902, an ape with leopard print skin wearing shades, a sailor shirt, and a crown. However, on April 7, Bryant was apparently hacked, and the thief stole not only his ape but Moonbirds, World of Women, and RumbleKongLeague NFTs (one each) and some various cryptocurrencies.The Bored Ape would likely fetch somewhere around $125,000 if resold. The other three NFTs would likely resell for somewhere around $8,700. Together with around $3,400 in stolen tokens, Bryant's total loss is around $139,000.After some observers spotted the suspicious-looking transactions, Bryant confirmed on Twitter: \"Yes my ape was stolen and I don't know how this is crazy\"."
