They added that the digital currency also has the \"potential to create new ways for young people to earn, spend, save and send money.\"

## Highlights

- Some Kenyan activists say it is easier to raise funds through non-financial transactions.
- They say it reduces the need for traditional funding channels to be used to raise money.
- Others say it has the potential to create new ways for young people to earn, spend, save and send money.
- The money raised through the sale of NFTs will help fund more and more projects in the country that need to be funded by the government, they say.
- The funds raised through NFT funds will be used for the construction of a giant plastic sculpture in Kenya, which was designed to help build a new museum of the same size as a museum of nature in Africa.
