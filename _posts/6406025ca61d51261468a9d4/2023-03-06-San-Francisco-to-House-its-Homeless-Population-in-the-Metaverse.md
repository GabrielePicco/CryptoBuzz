San Francisco’s first public-funded social network has opened a virtual home. The project aims to help the city's homeless homeless population. The city's first official social network is now in the form of social media networks.

## Highlights

- San Francisco is taking a unique & cost effective approach to tackling the homelessness crisis.
- The Metaverse is partnering with San Francisco’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing.
- A ribbon cutting ceremony was held Friday in Decentraland to inaugurate the opening of the Metaverse's largest permanent supportive housing building.
- The program gives the homeless population a free avatar and an NFT that entitles them access to a one room efficiency in the metaverse.
- At the ribbon cutting event, the tearful avatar of Shireen McSpadden said “this is not a place where someone lives for a couple of months and moves on,”
