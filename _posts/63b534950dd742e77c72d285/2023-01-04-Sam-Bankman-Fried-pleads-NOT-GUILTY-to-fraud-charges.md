Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX has pleaded not guilty to charges of cheating investors out of billions of dollars.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried pleads ‘NOT GUILTY’ to fraud charges – trial set for October 2 2023.
- 30-year-old accused of using customer deposits to purchase property, make huge political donations, and illegally support his hedge fund Alameda Research.
- Since 2019 he amassed an eye-watering net worth of $26 billion until a wave of suspicious withdrawals in November exposed a web of serious problems with the FTX platform and its ties to Alameda.
- Two of SBF’s colleagues – Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang – have already pleaded guilty to civil and criminal charges of conspiracy and fraud.
