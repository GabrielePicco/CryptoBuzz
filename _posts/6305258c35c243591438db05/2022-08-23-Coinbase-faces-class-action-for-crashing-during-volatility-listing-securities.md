A new class-action lawsuit is asking for $5 million in damages from Coinbase over the exchange's habit of crashing during market volatility.

## Highlights

- A class action filed on behalf of all Coinbase wallet and account holders says it doesn't employ standard practices to secure accounts.
- The SEC designated nine tokens trading on the exchange to be securities in July.
- A representative for the exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
- For the fourth quarter, the exchange reported 11.2 million monthly transacting users (MTU), the most ever and up from 2.8 million a year earlier.
- The complaint also claims that the exchange does not disclose that the crypto assets on its platform are securities and that it does not register as a securities exchange or as a brokerdealer.
- It also says that the company does not list its crypto assets as securities.
