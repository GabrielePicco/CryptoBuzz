The founder of the decentralized exchange dYdX (DYDX) believes that crypto builders should just focus on serving markets outside the United States for the next five to 10 years.

## Highlights

- Antonio Juliano says the regulatory uncertainty in the United States is not worth the “hassle” or “compromises” Juliano tells his 49,400 followers on the social media platform X. Juliano: “Crypto builders should just give up serving US customers for now and try to re-enter in 5-10 years It’s not really worth the hassle/compromise.
- Most of the market is overseas anyway.
- Innovate there, find PMF (product market fit), then come back with more leverage… The only thing that matters for all of us is crypto finding stronger product market fit.
