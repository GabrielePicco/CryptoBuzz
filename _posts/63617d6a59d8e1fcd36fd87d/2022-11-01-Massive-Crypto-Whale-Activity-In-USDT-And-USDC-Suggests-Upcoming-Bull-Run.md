Volatility is one of the distinguishing attributes of the crypto market that springs surprises in several observers. It creates a desirable environment for traders and investors in the crypto industry to advance with huge profits.

## Highlights

- The total market cap sits at $970 Billion, indicating a surge over the past 24 hours.
- The most significant digital assets with $100k+ whale transactions are the stablecoins USDT and USDC.
- US Department of Justice (DoJ) pushes the investigatory plans on Tether USDT.
- This new move is in line with the allegations against Tether executives in bank fraud.
- At the time of writing, the volume of all stablecoins is $81.19 billion representing about 92.76% of the cumulative digital asset market 24-hour volume.
