Prices for some of the most popular graphics cards are crashing at an aggressive rate thanks to the recent unprecedented cryptocurrency crash.

## Highlights

- Nvidia's popular RTX 3080 GPU is now available for less than $650 on eBay.
- Bitcoin and ETH mining profitability has fallen off a cliff in recent days due to the continuing decline of ETH prices.
- AMD-powered Radeon graphics cards are now selling for a price less than their MSRPs, save the RX 6800 XT and the RX 6650 XT.
- The value of Bitcoin has nosedived by a massive 30%, while Ethereum (which is compatible with Nvidia's RTX 30 cards) decreased by more than 40% in the past week.
- The crypto bubble that has been at the forefront of the GPU market has seen crypto miners grabbing nearly all stock for nearly all the past two years has seen.
