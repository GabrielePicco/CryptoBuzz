Belgian financial market supervisor will impose a new set of rules on the promotion of cryptocurrencies within its jurisdiction.

## Highlights

- Belgian financial market supervisor, the Financial Services and Markets Authority, will impose a new set of rules on the promotion of cryptocurrencies within its jurisdiction.
- The new regulations will come into effect on 17 May 2023.
- The message must be accurate and not misleading, ads must contain mandatory risk information, and crypto companies must inform FSMA ahead of any mass campaign.
- The regulatory move came after a survey that quizzed 1000 investors in November 2022.
- The FSMA conducted market research with IPSOS, which found that 80 percent of crypto investors are men.
- The foreign minister of Belgium recently called for a cryptocurrency ban, calling it a "speculative poison with no economic or social added value"
