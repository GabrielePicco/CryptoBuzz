How much would you pay to prevent a $470 million hack? For Arbitrum, the answer is 400 ETH (around $540K).

## Highlights

- Arbitrum Nitro paid 400 ETH (about $560,000) to a white hat hacker who found a potential vulnerability in its code.
- Arbitrum was the victim of an exploit in which a hacker or a group of hackers stole more than 100 NFT from TreasureDAO, with a valuation of at least $1.4 million.
- Riptide said the “multi-million dollar vulnerability” could potentially affect anyone who wanted to exchange funds from the Arbitrum chain to Arbitrum’s Nitro.
- The hacker decided to report the vulnerability and apply for a reward instead of the $2 million reward Arbitrum offered as its maximum tier.
