## Highlights

- According to the SEC, Ripple traded $1.3 billion in their cryptocurrency XRP as a security without notifying the commission.
- Ripple and other parties have now rebutted the watchdog’s judgment with claims of bias.
- Joseph Hall — the former SEC managing executive for policy — discussed the status of the case, how it has progressed so far, and what to expect moving forward.
- He said the SEC “has a lot riding on this lawsuit,” and their entire regulatory effort may be effectively ‘shut down” if they fumble on the merits.
