“HubCoin has a set value that isn't able to be duped or otherwise glitched, can't be farmed, and won't ever be handed out on the nexus. This is the real value of Hub Coin.”

## Highlights

- Players in No Man's Sky have created their own cryptocurrency called Hub Coin.
- It's a cryptocurrency, but not one that can be used to buy goods and services in the real world.
- Hub Coin was created in response to No Man’s Sky not launching with the kind of cooperative play features players wanted.
- It all comes down to the end game of the game, when the various in-game currencies become useless to players because they can duplicate any item.
- Unlike other cryptocurrencies, these players hope Hub Coin remains worthless.
- The rules prohibit it from being exchanged for real money, if you’d prefer to spend your own money over your own currency.
