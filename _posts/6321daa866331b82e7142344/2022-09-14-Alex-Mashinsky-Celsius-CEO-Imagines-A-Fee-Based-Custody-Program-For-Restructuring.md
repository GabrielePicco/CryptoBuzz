An anti-virus scan on your device can be used to make sure it is not infected with malware. Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary access to the web property.

## Highlights

- Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary access to the web property.
- You can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with malware.
- If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices.
- If you want to use it, run the system to look for mis-configured and infected devices in the network.
