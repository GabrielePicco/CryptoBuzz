The crypto platform LunarCrush will be stowing a bounty of 62 Bitcoin on the Moon, currently worth around $1.5 million — and it's completely up for grabs.

## Highlights

- LunarCrush will leave a bounty of 62 Bitcoin near the lunar south pole that's completely up for grabs.
- The goal of this stunt is to "inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration," CEO Joe Vezzani said.
- The bounty is called Nakomoto_1, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.
- It's not actually some space-shielded hard drive with Bitcoin sitting in it.
- Instead, it's merely a key to a private crypto wallet, engraved on a hidden portion of a lunar rover.
- The rover and its crypto bounty will be brought to the Moon aboard a SpaceX rocket launch scheduled for June.
