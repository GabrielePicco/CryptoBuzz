Last December I posted a viral article where I -correctly- called out Celsius Network for being a massive Ponzi Scheme. I now believe that the entire crypto lending industry is build around an astonishing and fraudulent playbook, the one used by Roger Ver a/k/a “Bitcoin Jesus” to gamble away $84m dollars of user funds from the crypto Lender CoinFLEX, leaving the company bankrupt and its depositors holding bags of bad debt.

## Highlights

- Roger Ver gambled away $84m dollars of user funds from the crypto Lender CoinFLEX, leaving the company bankrupt and its depositors holding bags of bad debt.
- The playbook used by Roger Ver is quite simple: invest in a crypto lender.
- Use your position as a shareholder/investor to take out massive un/under-collaterized loans at advantageous rates.
- Degen gamble this money and repay it.
- If your bet doesn’t pay out you just default on the lender and leave its depositor holding the bags.
- Ver is not the only one using this playbook, but Sam Bankman-Fried appears to be using it to an even crazier extend.
