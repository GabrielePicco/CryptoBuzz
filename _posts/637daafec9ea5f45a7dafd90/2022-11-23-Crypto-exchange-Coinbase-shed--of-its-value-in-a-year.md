That's probably greater than direct FTX-related losses.

## Highlights

- Market capitalization of Coinbase drops below $10 billion.
- This time last year, it was more than $70 billion.
- FTX's implosion is rippling across crypto markets in the U.S., causing a loss of trust in all the major players.
- BlockFi and Genesis have blocked withdrawals, with Genesis reportedly warning that it, too, might have to file for bankruptcy.
- If there's any kind of flight-to-quality trade in Coinbase's favor, however, it's not visible in the share price.
