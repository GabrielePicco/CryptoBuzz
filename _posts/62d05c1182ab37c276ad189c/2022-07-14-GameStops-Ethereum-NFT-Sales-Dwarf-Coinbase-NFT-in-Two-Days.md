The two-day-old platform, while still in beta, moved well over 3,000 ETH—minuscule compared to OpenSea, but a hit relative to Coinbase.

## Highlights

- GameStop's new NFT marketplace has seen at least 3,167 ETH in trading volume since Monday.
- That figure equalling almost $3.5 million, the only data publicly available.
- The video game retailer's new platform has already seen nearly twice the all-time trading volume of Bitcoin's NFT marketplaces like OpenSea.
- NFTs are tokens that show ownership over digital or physical assets, and GameStop is using the Ethereum blockchain.
- The company is taking a 2.25% commission on its NFT sales, so the actual revenue for GameStop NFT thus far is small.
- In February, GameStop launched a $100 million token incentive fund to support development of NFT-compatible video games and products.
