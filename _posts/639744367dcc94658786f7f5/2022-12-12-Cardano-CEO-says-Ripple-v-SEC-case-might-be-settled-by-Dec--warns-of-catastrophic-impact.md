Cardano's Charles Hoskinson has commented on the possible date for settling the case between the Securities Exchange Commission and Ripple.

## Highlights

- Charles Hoskinson has commented on the possible date for settling the case between the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain firm Ripple.
- Unconfirmed reports indicate that the final judgment might be read by December 15 but Hoskinson warned the outcome could have ‘catastrophic’ effects on the general cryptocurrency sector.
- Hoskinson was subjected to online backlash from XRP fans after he stated that Ripple is under SEC investigation due to a lack of clear regulations.
- However, Hoskinson hit back at the trolls noting that he was misquoted and that the XRP community has found himself on the wrong side of the Ripple community over the comments he made about the case.
