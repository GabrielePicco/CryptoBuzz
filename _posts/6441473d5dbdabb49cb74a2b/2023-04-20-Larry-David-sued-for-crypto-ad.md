David is being sued for being a \"brand ambassador\" for flailing cryptocurrency exchange FTX

## Highlights

- FTX is being sued in a class-action suit against the cryptocurrency exchange.
- Other big names in the suit include Tom Brady and the Golden State Warriors.
- FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11 and is under investigation by the U.S.
- Department of Justice.
- The lawsuit is the latest in a long series of criticism of FTX in the wake of the company's collapse.
- The case seems to be a good example of how the company is trying to get around the world around the issue of the collapse of the crypto exchange, but now it's under investigation again by the Department of Statesman for fraudulently transferring funds to the public sector.
