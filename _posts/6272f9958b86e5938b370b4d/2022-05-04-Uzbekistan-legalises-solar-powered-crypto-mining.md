Uzbekistan will allow companies to mine cryptocurrencies using solar energy and will exempt all crypto operations by domestic and foreign companies from income tax, according to a presidential decree published this week.  The Tashkent government wants miners to power their farms by installing their own solar panels.  Alternatively, mining companies can be connected to the power grid if they pay double the regular price.

## Highlights

- Uzbekistan will allow companies to mine cryptocurrencies using solar energy.
- The Tashkent government wants miners to power their farms by installing their own solar panels.
- Some cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are created by a process called proof of work which requires computers to "mine" the currency by solving complex puzzles.
- No license is required for mining but the company must be registered by a newly formed Uzbek National Agency for Perspective Projects.
- The central Asian nation has also launched a series of renewable energy projects, mostly solar and wind power plants.
- Neighbouring Kazakhstan, which became the world's second-largest centre for bitcoin mining after the United States last year, has cracked down on mining.
