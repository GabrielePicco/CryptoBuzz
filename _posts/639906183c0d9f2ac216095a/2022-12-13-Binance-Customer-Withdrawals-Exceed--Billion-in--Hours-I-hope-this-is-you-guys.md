The exchange saw a total net outflow of over $3.6 billion in the past week as crypto firms and users pulled out funds.

## Highlights

- Binance saw a total net outflow of over $3.6 billion in the past week as crypto firms and users pull out funds.
- CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that it’s just “business as usual.” Binance's exchange token, BNB, is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is down about 2% in past 24 hours, and down 8% in two weeks.
- Binance US withdrawals temporarily halted due to a token swap issue where the exchange was unable to convert funds due to the closure of a New York bank—the liquidity provider for the swap—being closed.
