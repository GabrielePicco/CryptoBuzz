Apple will accept the sale of NFTs using apps on its App Store, but some aren’t happy that it will come with a 30% commission to the technology giant.

## Highlights

- Nonfungible token (NFT) application developers and others have balked at a decision by tech giant Apple to impose a 30% commission on NFTs sold through apps on its App Store.
- The commission rate has however been slammed by some for being “grotesquely overpriced” — particularly when compared to standard NFT marketplace commissions, which are around 2.5%.
- Other NFT marketplaces on the App Store have reportedly limited functionality due to the hefty commissions.
- There is also the added challenge of being forced to conduct transactions in United States dollars rather than cryptocurrency, which could prove risky given the volatility of cryptocurrency markets.
