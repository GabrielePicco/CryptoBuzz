Nvidia sees a fall in their crypto revenue as Ethereum moves to proof of stake, as it stands it has fallen by more than 75%.

## Highlights

- Nvidia Corp.
- sees a fall in their crypto revenue as it stands it has fallen by more than 75% in the three months ended December compared to the prior quarter.
- The drop comes as miners prepare for the second-largest cryptocurrency’s transition to a less intensive proof-of-stake consensus method, which would no longer require strong graphics cards or specialized computers to secure transactions.
- Nvidia has also taken attempts to drive miners away from its consumer products by limiting the mining capabilities of its ordinary graphics cards and providing a dedicated line of processors for the purpose.
- Many are unlikely to see a payout before the migration, which is scheduled for June, based on the present trajectory.
