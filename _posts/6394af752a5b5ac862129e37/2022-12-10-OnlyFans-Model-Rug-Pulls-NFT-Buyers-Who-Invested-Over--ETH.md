The outcome is the same. SmolBoyz Land is dead, and the project - or the OnlyFans model - will not return.

## Highlights

- SmolBoyz Land was created by OnlyFans model Vanessa Sierra.
- Project raised 127 ETH but went up in smoke after co-founder ran off with funds over time.
- Sierra apologized on Discord for failing buyers and investors.
- Despite over 500k followers on Instagram, the project failed.
- It took a few months to cash everything out without raising suspicion.
- The site now redirects to Google.com.
