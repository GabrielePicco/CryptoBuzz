Influencers like BitBoy Crypto, Moon Carl, and MMCrypto are making big money and blurring ethical lines while offering bad cryptocurrency advice.

## Highlights

- A generation of new hype men are feeding audiences' fascination with cryptocurrencies on social media.
- But their predictions are often terribly wrong.
- Many heavily promote referral links for cryptocurrency exchanges, earning them thousands of dollars.
- Their profits come from far more than just cryptocurrency earnings.
- But their business practices show that they don't need to be right to make a killing off of their audiences.
- Unlike mainstream financial professionals, these influencers rarely have any training or knowledge of their credentials.
