The CEO of Airbnb, tweeted: \"If Airbnb could launch anything in 2022, what would it be?\" the overwhelming top request was bitcoin payments.

## Highlights

- Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, tweeted: “If Airbnb could launch anything in 2022, what would it be?” After 4,000 replies he saw that the overwhelming top request was bitcoin payments.
- Bitcoin is the first truly international currency, and users don’t need permission or ‘services’ from any institution.
- Businesses are beginning to see the possibilities this opens up.
- It may be no coincidence that this reaction to customer demand corresponds with a rise in competition from bitcoin and lightning friendly alternatives like Travala.com, which provides a holiday rental service, flight and expericence all payable with bitcoin and Lightning.
