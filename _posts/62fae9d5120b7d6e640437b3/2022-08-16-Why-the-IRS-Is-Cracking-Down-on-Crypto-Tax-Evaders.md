The IRS is getting serious about crypto tax evasion.

## Highlights

- Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is embarking on an exercise to ensure that crypto investors pay their fair share of taxes from crypto gains.
- The IRS sought information on customer information from SFOX Inc., a cryptocurrency dealer, in August 2022.
- The regulator requested a court in New York to summon SFOX and its partner M.Y.
- Safra Bank with the goal of acquiring account and transaction records for users with cryptocurrency transactions over $20,000 in any year from 2016 to 2021.
- The government says SFOX alone has over 175,000 users who have made $12 billion in transactions since 2015.
- The US does not have a clear regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry, a big chunk of which resides in the country.
