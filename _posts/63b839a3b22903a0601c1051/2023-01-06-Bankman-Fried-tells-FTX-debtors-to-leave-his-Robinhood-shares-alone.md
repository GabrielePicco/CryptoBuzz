FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has filed a court action seeking to block debtors from taking control over his $450 million stake in brokerage Robinhood.

## Highlights

- FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has filed a court action seeking to block debtors from taking control of his roughly $450 million stake in brokerage Robinhood.
- FTX, sister hedge fund Alameda Research and other related firms now in bankruptcy and under the control of court-appointed liquidators are seeking access to any assets they can find in order, including the Robinhood shares, to repay roughly 1 million creditors of FTX.
- Lawyers for the disgraced exchange boss argue the shares do not belong to any of the FTX-related entities now in the bankruptcy proceedings, and that he needs the money to fund his legal expenses.
