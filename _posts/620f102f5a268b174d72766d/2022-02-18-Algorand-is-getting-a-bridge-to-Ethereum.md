The Algorand Foundation has awarded Applied Blockchain a grant to develop a trustless bridge that will connect Algorand with Ethereum.

## Highlights

- The Algorand Foundation has awarded Applied Blockchain a grant to develop the London Bridge, a trustless bridge that will connect the network to other blockchains.
- London-based software development company Applied Blockchain will use the funding to bring the scaling solution to market.
- The company is also working on several applications based on the network, making it a natural choice to further develop London Bridge.
- The Foundation said that the bridge will also enable the network’s integration with other blockchain networks and provide a significant influx of liquidity to the growing network.
- The long-term strategy is to have all verification of the other chains to be performed within Algor and‘s smart contracts, the Foundation said.
