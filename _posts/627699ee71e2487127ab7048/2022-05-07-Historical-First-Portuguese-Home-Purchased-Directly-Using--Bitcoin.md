Though it required some extra steps, a Portuguese home buyer just facilitated a Bitcoin real-estate purchase without conversion to euros.

## Highlights

- The first-ever Portuguese real-estate purchase has been settled for Bitcoin – without involving conversion back to fiat money.
- The deal was for a T3 apartment in Braga, costing the buyer exactly 3 Bitcoin.
- Portugal’s Order of Notaries has since established clear rules on how to form deeds for real estate sales made directly in digital assets.
- The global south is increasingly turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as actual “currencies” and regulatory assurances are allowing them to be used as such.
- The Central African Republic has now become the second country to establish Bitcoin as legal tender.
- Panama has also legalized the use of cryptocurrencies for tax payments.
