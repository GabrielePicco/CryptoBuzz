Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed support for Russians and Belarusians who are protesting President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin tweeted that support for Ukrainians was a priority, but it was also important to back Russians and Belarusians who are not letting Putin’s “Z-ombie regime” represent them.
- He was responding to Anton Barbashin, the editorial director of Riddle, an online journal of Russian affairs, who said a European University should “openly welcome” Russian students kicked out from their institute for opposing the ongoing war.
- He also urged people to “extend their compassion to" those suffering from wars in other parts of the world.
- Until last week, more than $52 million had been donated in Bitcoin, Bitcoin and Dogecoin to Ukraine and non-governmental organizations.
