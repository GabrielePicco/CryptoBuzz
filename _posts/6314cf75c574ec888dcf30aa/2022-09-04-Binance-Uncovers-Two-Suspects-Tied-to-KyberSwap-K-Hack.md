The development comes less than 48 hours after hackers stole $265,000 worth of assets from KyberSwap.

## Highlights

- Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has identified two suspects who may be responsible for the theft of $265,000 from decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol KyberSwap in an exploit earlier this week.
- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) disclosed the findings on Twitter today.
- The company said it has involved government authorities in the matter for further investigation.
- Attackers launched a malicious code on the protocolâ€™s Google Tag Manager (GTM), prompting false approval that allowed them to move funds to their wallets.

- The protocol also disclosed that the exploiters would be rewarded with a 15% bug bounty if they returned stolen funds.
