Former President Donald Trump has said that his non-fungible token (NFT) trading cards were about \"art\" and not money.

## Highlights

- Trump spoke to conservative network OAN on Friday about trading cards.
- Digital trading cards that feature Trump as various characters such as superheroes, cowboys and an astronaut were originally sold for $99 each and all 45,000 were sold in the first 12 hours following their release.
- Trump said he knew nothing about the NFTS before and that he fell in love with the art.
- Trump acknowledged that those who initially bought the digital trading cards would have made a significant profit.
- The resale value of the cards on NFT trading platforms such as OpenSea has fluctuated since their release and the floor price on the website was $0.23, or about $280.
