US agencies are sparring over who gets to oversee the crypto industry, and companies are stuck in the middle.

## Highlights

- US regulators are sparring over who gets to oversee the crypto industry.
- The SEC and the CFTC have taken a more aggressive approach to the crypto market.
- Since the start of the year, the SEC has launched a flurry of cases against crypto firms and individuals in the US.
- Hester Peirce, one of five SEC commissioners, has dissented publicly against multiple crypto-related actions, in an effort to foster discussion and heal the “dysfunctional” relationship between the agency and the industry.
- Even within the SEC, there is disagreement over how the agency is handling crypto, with some calling the charges “a manufactured parking ticket”
