Fidelity will integrate Bitcoin into its 401(k) retirement offerings, allowing investors to allocate tax-advantaged retirement money to Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- Fidelity will integrate Bitcoin into its 401(k) retirement offerings.
- The company will charge a fee between.75% and.9% on Bitcoin held in a 401(K) retirement account.
- Fidelity has been integrating crypto into its products since 2018, so it's no surprise that they're the first major financial firm to announce support for Bitcoin.
- There are significant tax benefits to buying Bitcoin this way, so investors are still likely to come out ahead, though.
- Fidelity and its partners still extract good value, though.
- It seems like the retirement plan managers would make more fee income from assets they choose than they would make from Bitcoin holders.
