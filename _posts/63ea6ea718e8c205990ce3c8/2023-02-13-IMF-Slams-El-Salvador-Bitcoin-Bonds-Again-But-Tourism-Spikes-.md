The International Monetary Fund has issued a critical statement regarding El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds. The global body published a report stating that the country should address any risks. The IMF believes that there are potential macro and microeconomic risks to Bitcoin

## Highlights

- The IMF has criticized El Salvador for its decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in a statement published about the country’s economy.
- The global body published a report stating that the country should address any risks to Bitcoin's status as a legal tender.
- El Salvador's experiment with Bitcoin has been something of a hit-and-miss.
- The Central African Republic also recently made Bitcoin legal  tender, resulting in disapproval from the IMF.
- The authority has asked El Salvador to drop Bitcoin as a currency, though President Nayib Bukele has stuck to his guns.
- It has repeatedly expressed these concerns since 2021, but it has not made much of an impact.
