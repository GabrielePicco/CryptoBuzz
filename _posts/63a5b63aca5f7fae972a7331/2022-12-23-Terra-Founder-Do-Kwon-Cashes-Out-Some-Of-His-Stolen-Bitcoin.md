Reports emerged today that Do Kwon has cashed out Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time after fleeing to Serbia.

## Highlights

- Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon is believed to have cashed out Bitcoins for the first time after fleeing to Serbia.
- The report speculates that Serbia may have chosen Serbia as a destination for his escape because the country does not have an extradition agreement with South Korea.
- Serbia has two Bitcoin ATMs in the capital Belgrade where Bitcoin can be exchanged for fiat.
- People close to Kwon believe he needs escape funds to provide for his family abroad.
- At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $16,682, still facing major resistance at theÂ $16,900 level.
- The other leaders behind Terra Luna are not on the run.
