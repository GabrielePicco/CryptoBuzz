The crypto space is developing at an accelerated rate as projects such as Cardano continue to ship out impressive code. This fast-paced innovation has no

## Highlights

- Video of Solana founder mocking the Cardano process has drawn the ire of the DeFi community.
- Cardano is very strict about the code which they write and ship out to the community.
- While Cardano has been running non-stop for five years, Solana network continues to experience multiple downtimes.
- The network is not perfect (there’s no such thing), but the continuous commitment to ensuring investors’ safety has been the bedrock of the blockchain and why it has developed such a cult-like following of loyal users.
- Good things coming for Cardano are coming for the network, including the upcoming upgrade of Input Endorsers.
