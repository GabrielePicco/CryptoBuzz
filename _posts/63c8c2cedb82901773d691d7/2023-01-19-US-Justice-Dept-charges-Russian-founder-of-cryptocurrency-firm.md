A Russian national who founded a cryptocurrency exchange that evaded U.S. regulations and became a haven for the proceeds of criminal activity has been arrested, federal officials said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Anatoly Legkodymov, who lives in China, was arrested Tuesday night in Miami.
- He was due in court on a charge of conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business.
- Prosecutors allege his China-based cryptocurrency exchange did not implement required anti-money-laundering safeguards.
- The Justice Department said Bizlato conducted more than $700 million in cryptocurrency exchanges with users of a darknet marketplace for drugs, fake IDs and other illegal products.
- "Operating offshore or moving your servers out of the continental U.S.
- will not shield you," Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a news conference.
