In a historic move, Ethereum's longest-running testnet called Ropsten is transitioning to a proof-of-stake algorithm today.

## Highlights

- Ropsten, the longest-running testnet on the blockchain, is moving to a proof-of-stake algorithm today.
- The move is a crucial step before the move to the Consensus Layer (formerly known as ETH 2.0) slated for August this year.
- The biggest upgrade in Ethereum’s history—if successful—has a good chance to become the crypto industry’�s event of the year.
- The new PoS model is supposed to solve some of the biggest issues, such as high transaction costs and the network's ability to scale, so the stakes are indeed high, with the stakes being high.
- It gives developers the first taste of what things will look like in the future.
