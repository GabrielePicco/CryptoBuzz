Ethereum (ETH) massively recorded 4.5x more transactions surpassing the Visa digital payments in the year 2021.

## Highlights

- The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) became the trending talk of the town processing 4.5 times more transactions than Visa in 2021.
- As the entire crypto market is in an excited state to know that, ETH overtakes the prominent digital payment leader by its market capitalization.
- The platform went through various challenges last year as the platform faced scalability issues, new entrants in the smart contracts industry and rise in competitors in the markets and more.
- The London hard-fork EIP-1559 upgrade and implementation of Layer 2 scaling solutions are the major reasons for ETH high volume transactions.
- The number of ETH addresses increased with a 35% growth in just one year.
