They can't tell you what any of their bills are, either! No way they read 100’s of pages on these massive bills! They just vote for one thing in the bill, lie to the public, and go out

## Highlights

- No way they read 100’s of pages on these massive bills!
- They just vote for one thing in the bill, lie to the public, and go out for martinis afterwards.
- That's ok.
- They can't tell you what any of their bills are, either!
