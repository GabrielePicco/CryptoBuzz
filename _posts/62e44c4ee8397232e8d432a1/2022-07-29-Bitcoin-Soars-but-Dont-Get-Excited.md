Analysts don’t see this crypto rally as having strong legs—and predict prices are likely to stagnate around current levels.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were rallying on Thursday as investors piled back into risk-sensitive assets following the Federal Reserve’s latest decision on monetary policy.
- But analysts don’t see this rally as having strong legs, and predict prices are likely to stagnate at current levels.
- Bitcoin has made a steady advance from a bottom below $18,000 in June, topping out around $24,000 last week, before sliding back as markets headed into this turbulent week.
- The largest crypto surged in the wake of the Fed's Wednesday afternoon announcement, which delivered Bitcoin its best day in almost a month.
- Analysts say this rally is unlikely to have strong legs.
