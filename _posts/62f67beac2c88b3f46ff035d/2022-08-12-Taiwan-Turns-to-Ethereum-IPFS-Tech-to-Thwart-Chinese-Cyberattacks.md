As the volume of cyber attacks on the Taiwan government hits new highs, decentralized publishing tech is helping to keep its websites online.

## Highlights

- Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs has adopted IPFS technology to safeguard its infrastructure.
- IPFS is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that lets users backup and stores files and websites by hosting them across a network of nodes, eliminating centralized points of failure and circumventing censorship efforts.
- The news of the upgrade comes in the wake of U.S.
- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, the first for a senior-level official since 1997.
- The volume of cyber attacks on Taiwan government units on Tuesday surpassed 15,000 gigabits, 23 times higher than the previous daily record, according to the Digital Minister Audrey Tang.
