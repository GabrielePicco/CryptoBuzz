Somebody took advantage of the way the APE token airdrop works to net themselves a cool $1 million.

## Highlights

- ApeCoin airdropped 150 million tokens to anyone who owns one of their NFTs.
- Airdrop was not handed out based on snapshot of who owned which Bored Ape at a specific time in the past.
- Instead, it was claimable by anyone who owned one of the tokens.
- But someone found a way to claim the airdrop, using NFT's that they did not initially own, to carry it out.
- BlockSecTeam has labeled this attack an 'attack that an issue that is not an issue' BlockSec Team says user took advantage of a “vulnerability” based on how long a user had taken into account the event.
