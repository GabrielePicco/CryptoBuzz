Two US lawmakers have introduced a bipartisan bill that would require members of Congress to declare their crypto holdings.

## Highlights

- The Cryptocurrency Accountability Act would make it mandatory for members of Congress to report any purchase, sale or exchange of digital assets that exceeds $1,000.
- Lawmakers would also have to report crypto transactions made by their spouses and dependent children.
- The bill defines cryptocurrency as “any digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology” Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic Representative from Michigan, introduced the legislation on May 20th.
- Cynthia Lummis, a Republican Senator from Wyoming, teased the rollout of new digital asset legislation she plans to unveil next week.
- For that transgression, the bill would enable the Attorney General to bring a civil action against them.
