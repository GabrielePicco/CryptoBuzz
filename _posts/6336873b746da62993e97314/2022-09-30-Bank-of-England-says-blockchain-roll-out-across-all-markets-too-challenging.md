Using blockchain technology which underpins cryptoassets to offer instantaneous trading and settlement across all financial markets is not desirable given the challenges it would pose, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe says using blockchain to offer instant trading and settlement across all financial markets is not desirable.
- Instantaneous settlement means that cash and securities must be in place at the time a trade is struck, he said.
- Currently stock and bond trades are settled two business days after the transaction takes place, creating risky exposures and potential for big market moves in the meantime.
- The United States has set a March 2024 deadline for cutting this to one working day, putting pressure on Europe to follow suit.
- There are already pilot programmes for using distributed ledger technology or blockchain for instant trading, settlement of trades to cut costs and risks.
