The Taliban in Afghanistan has arrested several dealers of crypto tokens who resisted instructions to halt selling digital assets.

## Highlights

- Afghanistan's central bank has placed a ban on all transactions on cryptocurrencies.
- The move is a response to the fact that some Afghans have begun to store their riches in cryptocurrency in order to protect it from the reach of the Taliban.
- In Afghanistan, there are a total of six cryptocurrency brokerages; four of them can be found in the capital Kabul, which is around 121 kilometers (75 miles) from the border with Iran.
- Following Chinaâ€™s lead, Afghanistan has joined the ranks of countries that have made all cryptocurrency transactions illegal.
- In the aftermath of a market crisis that wiped away almost $2 trillion of value, governments are strengthening crypto regulations.
