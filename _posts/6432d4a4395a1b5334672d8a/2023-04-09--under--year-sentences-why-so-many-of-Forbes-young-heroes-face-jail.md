Ex-CEO Charlie Javice, 31, is just the latest from the magazine’s list to see criminal charges

## Highlights

- Charlie Javice was on Forbes's 30 Under 30 list for her tech startup Frank.
- She was accused of inflating the number of customers of her company to get JPMorgan Chase to buy it.
- She has been charged with conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
- Javice is not the first Forbes alum to suddenly be looking at decades in jail.
- Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli was in the finance category of the list in 2012.
- Sam Bankman-Fried, a self-described ‘effective altruist’, made the list.
