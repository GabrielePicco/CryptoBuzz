Data shows the Ethereum Proof-of-Work forks have sharply fallen down in the few days following the merge. Ethereum PoW Forks Have Fallen 66% In Just Five

## Highlights

- Data shows the ETH PoW forks have fallen 66% in just five days following the merge.
- Some communities that were in favor of the old PoW-based system decided to create forks as the merge came approaching.
- These new forks still rely on mining for reaching consensus on the network and have naturally attracted the stranded ETH miners.
- The report notes that this wasn’t something unpredictable as the forks were expected to struggle with amassing any meaningful adoption.
- At the time of writing, Ether’s price floats around $19.1k, down 5% in the last seven days.
- Over the past month, the crypto has lost 10% in value in value.
