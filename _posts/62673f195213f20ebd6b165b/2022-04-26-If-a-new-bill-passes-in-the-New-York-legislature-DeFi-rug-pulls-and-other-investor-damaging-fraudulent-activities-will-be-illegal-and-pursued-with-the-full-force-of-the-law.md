If a new bill passes in New York, DeFi rug pulls, scams, and other fraudulent activities will be illegal and initiators penalized.

## Highlights

- If a new bill passes in New York, DeFi rug pulls, scams, and other fraudulent activities will be illegal and pursued with the full force of the law.
- The bill, described under S8839 and forwarded by New York Senator, Kevin Thomas, seeks to make amends to penal law.
- Most importantly, it will help tackle fraud plaguing a multi-billion industry thatâ€™s rapidly expanding but insufficiently regulated.
- The law, they add, is necessary to provide long-lasting deterrence to the ever-evolving schemes in the crypto industry.
- The bill clarifies, defining a crypto rug pull as when the issuing team sells at least 10 percent of the total supply from the last sale date.
