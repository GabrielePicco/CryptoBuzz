Porygon-B - The Pokémon Company International opened up a new job listing for a Corporate Development Principal a few day...

## Highlights

- The Pokémon Company International opened up a new job listing for a Corporate Development Principal.
- The position requires the candidate to have a grasp of Web3, including blockchain.
- The listing was spotted on TPCi's Greenhouse page where all of the company's job listings are posted.
- Last year, the company took an Australian company to court over an NFT game promoting a Pokémon game called 'PokéWorld' It doesn't mean the company is planning to move into the blockchain industry just yet, but this listing does suggest it's potentially interested in dipping its toes in.
- Pokémon, of course, isn't just video games - there's a huge array of merchandise and media under the Pokémon umbrella.
