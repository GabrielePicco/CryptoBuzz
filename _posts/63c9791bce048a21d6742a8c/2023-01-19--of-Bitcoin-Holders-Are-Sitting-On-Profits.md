59% of Bitcoin holders are sitting on profits after months making losses. Any rally above $22k may trigger more demand in BTC.

## Highlights

- 59% of Bitcoin holders are profitable as the coin trades above the current Realized Price.
- That's the cost basis of the average Bitcoin holder, IntoTheblock data on January 19 shows.
- This development is a shot in the arm for HODLers, considering the sharp contraction of prices over the past few months.
- Any rally above $22k may trigger more demand in BTC.
- Even as BTC appears to recover, there must be a comprehensive breakout to solidify and revive demand in the market.
- The situation only worsened in subsequent months when fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swept across the crypto and BTC markets, forcing the coin even lower.
