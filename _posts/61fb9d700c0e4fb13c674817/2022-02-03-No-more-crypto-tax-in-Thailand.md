Thailand’s government will no longer continue its plan of implementing a crypto tax regime after crypto traders kicked against such plans.

## Highlights

- Thailand is canceling its plan to impose a 15% tax regime on crypto gains made in the country after crypto traders kicked against the move.
- The move will allow people who earn their incomes via crypto trading to report gains as capital gains on their income taxes.
- Other Asian countries like Singapore, China, and even South Korea have maintained a somewhat hostile stance towards the industry.
- The country is looking to hear from the public in shaping its crypto policies, but many people are displeased with this as well as the new rules as they say excessive tax would kill off a sector in its infancy.
- The new rules will also allow traders to offset their annual losses against gains made during the same year.
