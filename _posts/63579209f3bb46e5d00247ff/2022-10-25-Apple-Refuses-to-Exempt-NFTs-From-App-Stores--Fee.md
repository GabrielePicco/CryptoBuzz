The tech giant’s de facto ban on peer-to-peer NFT trading is likely here to stay.

## Highlights

- In-app NFT transactions must use Apple’s rails for in-app commerce, where Apple demands a 30% cut.
- Creators and marketplaces have long balked at the fees, choosing to limit NFT functionality rather than lose a massive slice of revenue.
- Apple's de facto ban on peer-to-peer NFT trading in apps is likely to remain, but it's likely here to stay.
- Apple demands 30% of the transaction fee to make transactions use its rails, which are Apple's rails in its apps.
