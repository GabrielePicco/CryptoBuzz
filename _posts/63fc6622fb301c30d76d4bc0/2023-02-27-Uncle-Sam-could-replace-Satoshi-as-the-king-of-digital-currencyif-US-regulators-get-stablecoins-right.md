People around the world already embrace the dollar. If the U.S. is smart, it will embrace stablecoins to make the dollar even more appealing.

## Highlights

- Last week, the SEC sent shockwaves across the crypto industry as news leaked that it was charging Paxos for issuing an unregistered security in its BUSD stablecoin.
- If properly regulated, stablecoins have the potential to cement U.S.
- financial hegemony for a generation, says Jeff Kohn.
- Kohn: Stablecoins are acting as the hedge against inflation that Bitcoin was supposed to be.
- If stablecoin adoption continues apace, it could be a trillion-dollar industry by the end of the decade.
- An American CBDC would present a massive invasion of privacy and concentrate unprecedented power in the hands of central bankers, Kohn says.
