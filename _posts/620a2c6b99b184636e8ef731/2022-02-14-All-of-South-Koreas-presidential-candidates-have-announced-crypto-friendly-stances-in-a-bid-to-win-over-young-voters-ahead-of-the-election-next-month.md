Presidential candidates are wooing young retail investors who may decide the outcome of the upcoming election.

## Highlights

- South Korea's presidential candidates have announced crypto-friendly stances in a bid to win over young voters ahead of the election next month.
- Real policy details will come post-election once a new administration comes to power.
- Real estate is the biggest issue on voters’ minds in South Korea now as young people under the age of 24 earn salaries of around KRW 2.6 million (US$2,176) a month, face expensive Seoul rent and have no hope of buying an apartment.
- There are more than 5 million individual crypto accounts across the country’s top three crypto exchanges, according to Edward Hong, head of platform at crypto venture capital firm Hashed.
