According to a recently published working study, most Salvadorans stopped using the Chivo wallet after getting their $30 bitcoin bonus.

## Highlights

- Working Study Says Despite Legal Tender Status, Bitcoin Is Not a Widely Accepted Medium of Exchange in El Salvador.
- Only 4 out of 10 Salvadorans Use Chivo Wallet after Government’s Bitcoin Bonus.
- NBER conducted a face-to-face survey with 1,800 Salvadoran households during the month of February 2022.
- The study shows that Salvadorans are not using the Chivo wallet that much and in February, El Salvador's central bank noted that only 1.6% of remittances were sent via digital wallets.
- In fact, the fixed cost to adopt the wallet was very large and if it wasn’t for the $30 bitcoin bonus, the study estimates that 75% of Salvadorans surveyed would have never used it.
