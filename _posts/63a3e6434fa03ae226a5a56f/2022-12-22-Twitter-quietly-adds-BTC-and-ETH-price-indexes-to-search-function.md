Twitter has integrated a new price chart feature that enables users to quickly search up the price of BTC and ETH as the social media giant continues to ramp up crypto integrations onto the platform.

## Highlights

- Twitter has added a new price chart feature that enables users to search the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) simply by typing their names or tickers into the search tab.
- The new feature is an improvement of "$Cashtags" and was announced by the Twitter Business account on Dec.
- 21.
- Twitter CEO Elon Musk retweeted the announcement of the new feature, saying it is "one of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter" Other top cryptocurrencies, including Muskâ€™s beloved Dogecoin (DOGE), have not made the cut.
- It appears that BTC and ETH are the only two cryptocurrencies with price charts at the time of writing.
