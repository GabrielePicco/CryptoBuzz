\"The LetsWalk collection giveaway is now available! Only 1,000 lucky people can qualify! Good luck!\" the hacker wrote.

## Highlights

- Korean NFT artist DeeKay Kwon’s Twitter account was hacked and used for a phishing attack.
- As a result, over $150,000 worth of NFT was stolen from his followers.
- The hacker posted a malicious link to a website asking users to approve a transaction to gain access to an exclusive collection token (NFT) giveaway.
- After victims approved the transaction, the hacker emptied their wallets and sold about $90,000 in NFTs.
- About five hours after the attack began, Kwon was able to resume control of his account, removed the link to the phishing site and apologized for the unfortunate event.
