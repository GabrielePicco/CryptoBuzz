Bill Murray's first NFT event was \"far more fun\" than a family picnic, he told Decrypt—and holders appeared to agree. Can it be replicated?

## Highlights

- Bill Murray is the face of a celebrity NFT collection.
- The Bill Murray 1,000 NFT project is part fan club and part autobiography.
- Members of the NFT can party with Murray at events hosted by Web3 startup Project Venkman and comedy website The Chive.
- Murray hosted a members-only bash at an Oceanside, California golf course last weekend.
- The actor hosted a putting contest and pie-eating contest for NFT members at Goat Hill Park.
- The event was hosted by a group of Murray fans who were asked in advance not to hound the actor, but he didn't appear to mind being in the mix during his three-hour stay.
