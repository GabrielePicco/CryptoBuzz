A Chainalysis report has revealed that $2 billion in crypto has been stolen from cross-chain bridges this year alone.

## Highlights

- Chainalysis report says $2 billion in crypto has been stolen from cross-chain bridges this year alone.
- Bridge hacks account for 69% of total crypto stolen in 2022, amounting to $2B in losses.
- 13 separate bridge hacks have taken place this year, with the most recent being the $190 million Nomad Bridge attack.
- Chainalysis says bridge hacks are often targets because they feature a central storage point of funds that back the ‘bridged’ assets on the receiving blockchain, making their protocols vulnerable to exploitation by hackers.
- The report comes from Chainalysis, which stressed that cryptocurrency services should start investing in security upgrades and training sooner rather than later.
