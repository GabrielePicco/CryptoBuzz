\"In one click my entire net worth of $1 million, gone. Is there any hope? Am I GMI? Can snipers show mercy?\"

## Highlights

- NFT collector loses his entire net worth "in a single click" DinoDealer had intended to list his Ether Rock for 444 ETH — worth a jaw-dropping $1.2 million at current rates.
- But instead, he confused this for the smaller denomination of Ether, meaning it was advertised for sale at 444 WEI.
- Bot snapped up the rock for just $0.0012 — and instantly began offering the NFT to the marketplace for 234 ETH.
- If sold, this would result in a tidy profit of about $650,000.
- Users offer condolences and offer NFT rocks as a small form of compensation on social media.
