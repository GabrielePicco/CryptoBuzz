A deep-dive into the bleeding Bitcoin buys of Microstrategy and Tesla ahead of earnings reports in July.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk and Microstrategy are down by almost $2 billion dollars on their Bitcoin (BTC) buys.
- Tesla automotive company bought over 40,000 Bitcoin during the 2021 bull market, Musk's $1 billion profit has gone south.
- The total impairment loss (the loss in value) shared between the billionaire Bitcoin believers is roughly $1.4 billion.
- For some Bitcoin believers, such as Bitcoin's first restaurant chain Tahini’s, “nothing has changed” They will continue to accumulate, albeit at much lower prices, even at lower prices.
- For others, they will have to top up a loan if the price of Bitcoin hits $21,000.
