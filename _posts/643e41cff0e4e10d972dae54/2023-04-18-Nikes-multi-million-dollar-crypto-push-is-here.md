Nike's web3 platform is launching its first drop of digital sneakers.

## Highlights

- Nike drops its first drop of digital sneakers on its web3 platform, the blockchain-powered platform.
- Consumers will be able to buy digital images of virtual show boxes for $19.82.
- Each box will eventually unlock various digital versions of Nike’s “iconic Air Force 1” sneakers, which were first sold in 1982.
- The move to leave crypto lingo like NFTs or blockchain out of the equation follows similar promotions launched by The Rolling Stones and Fox Entertainment.
- The trend away from using industry lingo may be a fallout from the series of crypto scandals that keep unraveling, or an attempt to mainstream the technology by using everyday language.
