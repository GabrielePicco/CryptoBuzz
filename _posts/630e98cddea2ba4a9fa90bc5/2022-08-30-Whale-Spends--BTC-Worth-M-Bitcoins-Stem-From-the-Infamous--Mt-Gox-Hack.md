10,000 bitcoin from the June 19, 2011, Mt Gox hack moved this week after sitting idle for close to nine years.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price dipped below the $20K per unit region for the first time since mid-July.
- Onchain data shows the 10,000 coins moved this week originally came from the Mt Gox breach that occurred on June 19, 2011.
- A 2013 whale moved approximately 10,001.514 BTC on Sunday, August 28, and on Monday, August 29, 2022.
- The funds stemmed from two addresses (1,& 2) created eight years and eight months ago on December 19, 2013.
- The 2013 bitcoins spent on Sunday and Monday were originally derived from wallet 1McUC that once held 134,897.01 BTC after getting the coins in June 2011.
- The whale's mega stash of 134K BTC gradually depleted in fractions over the last 11 years.
