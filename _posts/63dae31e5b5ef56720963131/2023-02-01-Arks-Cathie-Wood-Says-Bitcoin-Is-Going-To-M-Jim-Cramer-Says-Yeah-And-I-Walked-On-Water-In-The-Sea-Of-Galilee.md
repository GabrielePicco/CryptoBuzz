Ark Invest founder and CEO Cathie Wood is doubling down on her prediction that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will reach $500,000 and Jim Cramer can't help but laugh.

## Highlights

- Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood is doubling down on her prediction that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will reach $500,000.
- Wood said the price of one bitcoin could exceed $1 million in the next decade.
- Jim Cramer, who sold out of his Bitcoin and Ethereum positions in 2021, couldn't hold back his laughter following the interview.
- Cramer's outlook on the crypto space went back and forth during the most recent bull run, but since he cut his positions and bought a farm with the earnings in late 2021, he has stood by the sentiment that crypto is likely just a "gigantic con" Cramer said it's like she's "looking at a painting upside down"
