According to Nomics, over 12,000 cryptocurrency projects have barely seen any trade activity in recent months.

## Highlights

- There Will Be Over 12,000 Inactive Cryptocurrencies by 2022, says Nomics study.
- Roughly 13,800 of the more than 60,000 projects that Nomics monitors scarcely saw any trading activity in the last day.
- The current bear market will make it difficult for even worthwhile initiatives to continue operating as they will no longer have access to funding and resources.
- Meme tokens are the most negatively affected initiatives, with Elonmoon, a blockchain platform for moon exploration, and BoomSpace, no longer runs a website and hasnâ€™t posted anything to its social media profiles since June.
- In 2018, 136 tokens in total turned into zombies, while 766 coins did so in 2019, a much lower number than this year.
