Bitcoin eats ask liquidity as short squeeze sends BTC price to pre-Binance regulatory debacle levels.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $28,000 on March 29 as a classic short squeeze took the market to five-day highs.
- The abrupt uptick came courtesy of exchanges, where a band of shorts was “blown out” to remove resistance and allow higher levels to return.
- Total BTC short liquidations for March 29 stood at nearly $20 million at the time of writing.
- The price action effectively erased any trace of losses engendered by the news that the largest crypto exchange, Binance, was being targeted by U.S.
- regulators.
- In order for short-term upside to continue, bulls would need to muster some serious buying power.
