The longtime CEO of Kraken is stepping down but will stay on as chairman of the board.

## Highlights

- Jesse Powell, the CEO of Kraken, is stepping down from the top job at the cryptocurrency exchange he founded in 2011.
- Powell says he has grown tired of long hours and day-to-day management tasks.
- Chief Operating Officer Dave Ripley will succeed Powell in the coming months.
- Powell and Ripley say Kraken’s business is thriving, and that the company “piled up a ton of cash” during the recent bull market that will help it weather the current downturn.
- Powell: “The world is a changing place, and Bitcoin is anti-fragile and a safe haven from what's happening in the legacy financial system”
