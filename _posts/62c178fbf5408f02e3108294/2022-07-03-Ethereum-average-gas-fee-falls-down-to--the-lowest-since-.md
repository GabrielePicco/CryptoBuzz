Supporting this dip in gas prices, Cointelegraph uncovered on Saturday that the daily NFTs sales have also dropped to one-year lows.

## Highlights

- The average transaction fee on the Ethereum blockchain fell down to 0.0015 ETH or $1.57 â€” a number previously seen in December 2020.
- Starting in January 2021, gas fees surged owing to the hype around nonfungible tokens (NFT), decentralized finance (DeFi) and a promising bull market.
- Supporting this sudden drop in gas prices, Cointelegraph uncovered on Saturday that the daily NFTs sales have also dropped to one-year lows.
- The NFT ecosystem recorded its worst performance of the year in June as the total number of daily sales fell to roughly 19,000 with an estimated value of $13.8 million.
