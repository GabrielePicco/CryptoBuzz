Celsius has made a significant payment to Compound, as it transferred $10 million of DAI to the latter service today.

## Highlights

- Celsius has sent $10 million worth of the DAI stablecoin to Compound Finance, a popular interest-yielding DeFi service.
- The firm disabled withdrawals, transactions, and swaps on June 13.
- Celsius has made a number of other repayments over the past week, as well.
- The price of Celsiusâ€™ native token has risen since the firm announced it would freeze funds.
- Celsius' price of CEL is rising but likely due to a short squeeze rather than a genuine recovery.
- Today's payment is likely a step toward solvency, but it only makes up a small fraction of Celsius' activity.
