Cannabis and crypto go a long way. They share the same \"high\" and miseries.

## Highlights

- Cannabis use has been legalized for both recreational and medical use, but it is still considered illegal under most laws.
- Cannabis dispensaries and companies have been snubbed by credit card networks and banks that forced them to keep their cash mostly on-site which make them a common prey for robbers.
- With cryptocurrency use, marijuana traders can easily send and accept crypto payments as well as hold crypto securely on cold wallets.
- There are some notable downsides to using crypto instead of cash for this type of transaction transaction transaction.
- However, using crypto could be inconvenient, especially for those who are new to the crypto space and have no idea about paying with digital assets.
