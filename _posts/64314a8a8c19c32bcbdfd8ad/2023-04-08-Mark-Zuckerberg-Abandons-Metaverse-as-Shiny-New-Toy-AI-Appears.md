Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apparently all but abandoned dead-eyed, lifeless metaverse avatar as he focuses on Meta's AI shift.

## Highlights

- Facebook-turned-Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Nikkei Asia that Mark Zuckerberg has all but abandoned the Metaverse of dead-eyed avatars.
- Instead, he's focusing on generative AI, which he says is the focus of his company's focus.
- In the short term, he says Meta is gearing up to deploy AI in its advertising machine, the channel where the company makes the vast majority of its money, as opposed to the metaverse, which at this point is a multibillion-dollar money pit.
- The company has been working on AI R&D for years, and its large language model, LLaMa, is rumored to be quite powerful.
