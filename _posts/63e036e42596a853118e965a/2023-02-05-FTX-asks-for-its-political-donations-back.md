- 28.
- Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX Digital Markets Co-CEO Ryan Salame were two of the largest political donors during the last election cycle.
- FTX's debtors are confidentially contacting "political figures, political action funds and other recipients" The move comes after FTX issued a request in December for fund recipients to voluntarily return the payments.
