## Highlights

- Square Enix has announced its NFT (or non-fungible token) project after threatening us with the company’s embrace of the controversial and largely reviled-by-gamers blockchain technology.
- Starting today, consumers will be able to pre-order a physical action figure that comes with a code redeemable for a digital NFT.
- There will also be physical trading cards that similarly have NFT components available for pre-orders later this year.
- NFTs will be made from Final Fantasy VII, a relatively obscure indie game about a bunch of freedom fighters taking down a corporation that's killing the planet.
- Currently, there are no images available of what the action figure or the collectible cards will look like or how much they’ll cost.
