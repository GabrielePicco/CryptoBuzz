The SEC has approved four Bitcoin futures ETFs but not a single Bitcoin spot ETF. Grayscale is working to change that.

## Highlights

- Grayscale is seeking to create a Bitcoin spot ETF.
- The SEC has approved four Bitcoin futures ETFs but not a single Bitcoin spot-ETF.
- In a letter sent last week to the SEC, the firm's attorneys argued that the SEC's approval of the fourth Bitcoin futures ET, Teucrium, earlier this month, opened the door for a spot-traded Bitcoin spot.
- The move would be the first of its kind: The SEC is expected to decide on the application by July.
- CEO Michael Sonnenshein tweeted recently that he'd consider suing the SEC if the bid is rejected, citing the 1933 act as a reason.
