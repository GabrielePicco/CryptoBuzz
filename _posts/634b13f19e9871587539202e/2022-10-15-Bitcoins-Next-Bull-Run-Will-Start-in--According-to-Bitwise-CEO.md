Hunter Horsley joined the list of people who think the best time to invest in bitcoin is during the ongoing crypto winter.

## Highlights

- Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, believes bear markets are a great period when investors could increase their exposure to bitcoin.
- He estimated that the next bull run will begin next year, outlining that his firm’s clients have already increased their interest in the asset.
- In his view, those who hop on the bandwagon now (when prices are much lower compared to last year) have a better chance to generate significant profits in the future: "Bear markets are the moments when fortunes can be made," he said in an interview for Bloomberg.
- He added that there have historically been four-year cycles, while bull runs with growing momentum have always followed bear markets.
