Yoon defeated his liberal opponent in a contest in which cryptocurrency issues were unusually prominent.

## Highlights

- Conservative Party candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol will become South Korea’s next president.
- The election was one of the closest in South Korean history.
- Both Yoon and Lee announced crypto-friendly stances in an attempt to win over younger voters.
- There are at least 14 crypto-related bills currently circulating in the South Korean parliament, and the lack of clear regulation has frustrated many in the industry.
- Yoon pledged to raise the proposed threshold for capital gains taxes to kick in on cryptocurrency profits to KRW 52.4 million (US$42,450) Starting in 2023, a 20% tax is to be levied on crypto gains above KRW 2.5 million ($2,024) earned in under a year.
