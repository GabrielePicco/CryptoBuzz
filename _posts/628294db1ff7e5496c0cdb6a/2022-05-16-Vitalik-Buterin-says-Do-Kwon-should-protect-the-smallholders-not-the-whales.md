Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks there should be some sort of financial deposit insurance for the smaller LUNA and UST investors.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin thinks Terra project should prioritize small hodlers as part of any proposed reimbursement plan.
- The Terra eco-system suffered a death spiral around May 9 that resulted in LUNA tanking 100% and the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin losing its United States dollar peg.
- The community is looking at ways to reestablish the ecosystem and potentially offer relief to the many people who got burned financially.
- The payout is estimated to cost between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, but it's unclear if the project will be able to rebuild or if it will aim for a temporary resurgence to recoup investor losses.
- Another idea being floated around online is to develop a hard fork upgrade for the Terra blockchain dubbed “TERRA 2,”
