Sam Bankman-Fried — who Twitter owner Elon Musk has been heavily firing shots at left and right — is actually Musk's partner in the deal.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was an investor in Elon Musk's Twitter deal.
- FTX CEO was willing to contribute $3 billion to Musk's takeover bid to buy Twitter.
- Previously undisclosed texts have revealed that SBF was Musk's partner at Twitter.
- SBF — who Musk has been firing shots at left and right — is actually the SpaceX CEO's partner in the deal, according to a new report by the FTX creator.
- And now that's the narrative he has been pushing, and unfortunately, it won't cut it for him, it simply won't.
- And considering a series of crude memes of rhinos mating rhinos and rhinos, it's not easy to explain.
