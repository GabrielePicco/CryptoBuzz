The country uses its stolen funds to finance its missile program. As of November, North Korea had carried out 34 weapon tests involving 88 missiles this year.

## Highlights

- The National Intelligence Service said that more than half of the assets stolen, or about $626 million, had been taken in 2022 alone.
- North Korea is considered one of the world’s foremost nation-based cyberthreats along with China, Russia, and Iran.
- The thieves honed their skills after the UN tightened economic sanctions in 2017, which banned the export of North Korean goods including coal, textiles, and seafood, in response to the country's test of nuclear weapons and missiles.
- As of November of this year, North Korea had carried out 34 weapon tests involving about 88 ballistic and cruise missiles, financed in large part by the country’ illicit activity.
