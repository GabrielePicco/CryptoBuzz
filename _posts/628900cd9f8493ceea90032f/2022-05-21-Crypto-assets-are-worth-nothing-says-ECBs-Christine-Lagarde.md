ECB president also signals preference for interest-rate hike of 25 basis points in July.

## Highlights

- European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says the value of crypto assets "is based on nothing" Comments come as the crypto market, more broadly, is taking a beating.
- She signaled again that the ECB is ready to hike interest rates in July to fight inflation in the eurozone.
- Lagarde also signaled that she may favor a slower tightening path, cautioning that ECB doesn't want to put the brakes on a "car that is moving" ECB bond buys are currently expected to be phased out early in the third quarter, opening the door for a rate hike in July, Lagarde said.
- She also downplayed the chance of a 50-basil basis-point hike, saying a 50 basis point hike "is not something that I can tell you"
