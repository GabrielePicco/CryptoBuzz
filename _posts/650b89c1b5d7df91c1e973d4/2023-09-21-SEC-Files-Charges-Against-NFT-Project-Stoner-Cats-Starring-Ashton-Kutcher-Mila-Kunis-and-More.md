The animated Web3 series cast, including Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Jane Fonda, Chris Rock and Seth MacFarlane, were paid from NFT profits according to the SEC.

## Highlights

- The animated Web3 series features the voices of Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Chris Rock, Jane Fonda, Seth MacFarlane and more.
- The NFT offering (which raised more than $8 million) gave buyers access to watch the series, their own “Stoned Cat” avatar and promised the creation of future animated projects.
- The SEC says that the illicit funds were used to pay the voice cast, as well as the animators, writers and others involved in the production of the show.
