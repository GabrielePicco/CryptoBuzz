GameFi has been a particularly interesting landscape over the past year, and while the cryptocurrency market at large has been middling - in the midst of

## Highlights

- GameFi has been a particularly interesting landscape over the past year, while the cryptocurrency market at large has been middling.
- Active users in the top games, including the likes of Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Decentraland, and more, have declined by roughly 96% from November 2021 peaks.
- GameFi needs to find more avenues of sustainability, and good products entering the market should help fuel that.
- The market needs to hone in on cost of entry, token inflation, and incentives, according to a new report from Arcane Research.
- There is still an abundance of opportunity in the gaming and crypto crossover space, but until a major P2E competitor hits the market that threatens traditional publishers and developers, it could be a slow burn
