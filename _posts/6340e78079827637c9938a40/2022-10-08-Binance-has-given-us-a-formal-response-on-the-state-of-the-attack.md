An official response to recent events from the BNB Chain team.

## Highlights

- There was an exploit affecting the native cross-chain bridge between BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2) and BNB Smart Chain.
- A total of 2 million BNB was withdrawn, but the majority of the funds remain under control.
- A new on-chain governance mechanism will be introduced on the BNB Chain to fight and defend future possible attacks.
- A Whitehat program for future bugs found, $1M for each significant bug found.
- A Bounty for catching hackers, up to 10% of the recovered funds.
- A BSC validator voting function for general opinions will be switched on in the next few days via an upgrade of BEP Beacon Chain.
