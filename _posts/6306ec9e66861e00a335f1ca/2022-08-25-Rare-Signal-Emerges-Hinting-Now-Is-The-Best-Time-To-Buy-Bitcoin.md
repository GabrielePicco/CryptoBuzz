The time-tested hash ribbons indicator flagged a rare buy signal on Friday, suggesting now is the best time to buy bitcoin.

## Highlights

- Hash ribbons, an indicator with a proven track record of spotting opportunistic entry points for bitcoin, has flashed a buy signal suggesting now is a prime period to purchase the peer-to-peer currency.
- Buying bitcoin at the end of a miner capitulation period often produces outsized returns for investors as the worst is believed to be over and the market is beginning a recovery.
- In the previous Bitcoin bear market, following the 2017 blow-off top, hash ribbons flagged a buy opportunity as BTC was trading at around $3,600 on Jan.
- 10, 2019.
- Over the following year, bitcoinâ€™s price increased by 127% to $8,200 after having scored returns of 233% in six months.
