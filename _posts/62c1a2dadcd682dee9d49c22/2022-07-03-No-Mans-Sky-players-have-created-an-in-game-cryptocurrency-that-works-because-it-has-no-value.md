No Man's Sky's unofficial official community group The Galactic Hub have launched a treasury, and cryptocurrency, to add end-game value (though it has no value)

## Highlights

- No Man's Sky's unofficial official community group The Galactic Hub have launched a treasury, and cryptocurrency, to add end-game value.
- Hub Coin is a cyptocurrency that exists on an Etherium testnet, kind of the cryptocurrency version of monopoly money.
- You can still trade it for stuff, but not, like, real stuff with any value.
- The only value it has is in the game, and it can't be exchanged for actual money.
- But it has been modestly successful so far, because its purpose is to facilitate having fun in a video game, not pump value so whales can cash out of their Herbalife-but-for-bros scheme.
