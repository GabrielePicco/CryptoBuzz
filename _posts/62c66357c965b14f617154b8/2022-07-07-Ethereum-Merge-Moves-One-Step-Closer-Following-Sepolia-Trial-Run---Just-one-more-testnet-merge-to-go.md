Another Ethereum testnet, Sepolia, has moved over to proof of stake. By the end of the year, the entire network should complete the Merge.

## Highlights

- Another testnet, Sepolia, has moved over to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.
- By the end of the year, the entire network should complete the Merge, a long-awaited update to the network.
- The Merge is expected to be fully completed before the end this year.
- The next test will take place on the Goerli testnet.
- After that, the whole network will move across to a proof of stake system, using the same consensus method as Bitcoin, known as proof of work.
- Critics say it's less decentralized and therefore less secure and will have knock-on effects for ETH, which currently has an unlimited supply.
