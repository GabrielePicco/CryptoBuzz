A UK-based firm may have found a win-win solution to help keep pools open and reduce the environmental impact of global compute and bitcoin mining.

## Highlights

- UK startup uses ‘digital boiler’ to heat pools for free.
- Boiler accounts for 60% of pool’s energy usage saving them £20,000 a year.
- Company rents their compute for use in AI training and machine learning workloads.
- Company has plans to install their devices in Bristol and Manchester in the near future.
- This is a win-win solution to help keep pools open and reduce the environmental impact of global compute and bitcoin mining using “data furnaces” – in short, use excess heat for good.
- Deep Green Technologies also has future plans to deploy their devices to Bristol and.
