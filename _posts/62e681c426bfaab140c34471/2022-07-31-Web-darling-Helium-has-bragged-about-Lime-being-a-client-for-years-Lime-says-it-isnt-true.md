Helium has been hailed as a Web3 success story, partly due to its advertised partnership with escooter company Lime. But apart from a trial run, the two companies have never worked together.

## Highlights

- Helium, a decentralized wireless network service, touted Lime as one of its marquee clients.
- Lime is preparing to send a cease and desist to Helium over its use of Lime's name and logo on its website and in its marketing.
- Lime says it has not had, and does not currently have, a relationship with Helium.
- The service bills itself as a peer-to-peer network for the Internet of Things.
- Lime's senior director for corporate communications Russell Murphy said there was a "brief test of [Helium's] product that didnâ€™t last beyond a month or two" in the summer of 2019.
- There has been no contact between Helium and Lime since then.
