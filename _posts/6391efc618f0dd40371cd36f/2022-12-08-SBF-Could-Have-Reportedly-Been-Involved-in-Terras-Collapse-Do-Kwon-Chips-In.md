Bankman-Fried could have supposedly played a role in the crash of UST and LUNA.

## Highlights

- US authorities have launched an investigation to determine whether Sam Bankman-Fried manipulated trades that led to the collapse of UST and LUNA earlier this year.
- Federal prosecutors have yet to decide whether or not the 30-year-old American is guilty.
- People familiar with the matter revealed that he might have machinated the market to benefit FTX and Alameda Research.
- The crash of the blockchain protocol – Terra – and that of the exchange – FTX – are undoubtedly the most negative events that took place recently.
- Do Kwon – Co-Founder of Terraform Labs – shared the report on his Twitter account, saying, “what’s done in darkness will come to light.”
