Binance is not responsible for \"rug pulls\" on Binance Smart Chain, an exchange representative says.

## Highlights

- Binance is not responsible for "rug pulls" on Binance Smart Chain, an exchange representative says.
- The exchange retains a significant degree of control over the chain, making it far more centralized than competing blockchains.
- A Binance representative on Wednesday suggested that's just the way things are in DeFi, and there's little the world's largest exchange can do to roll back the exploits.
- It's the case even though the exchange retains significant control over Binance's Smart Chain.
