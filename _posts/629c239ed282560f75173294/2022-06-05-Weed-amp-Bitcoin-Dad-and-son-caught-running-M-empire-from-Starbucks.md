A father and son in Washington have been handed five years jail time for swapping cash for Bitcoin and running an illegal marijuana business.

## Highlights

- Kenneth Rule, 28, and Kenneth John Rule, 47, sentenced to five years in prison for running an illegal $13 million marijuana business alongside a lucrative Bitcoin-for-cash money laundering scheme.
- The pair racked up $2.5 million in net profits without applying for a state license or paying taxes.
- Kenneth Rule ran his Bitcoin for cash scheme from Starbucks and even met undercover agent posing as a human trafficker in a coffee shop.
- A similar case was concluded last year when one California resident was sentenced to three years in jail after laundering $13million worth of Bitcoin for an undercover agent in the case.
- Prosecutors working on the father and son case said, â€œPerhaps, as is so often true in fraud cases, they were motivated by simple greed
