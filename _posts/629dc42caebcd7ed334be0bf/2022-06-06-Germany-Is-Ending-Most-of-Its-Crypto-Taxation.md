Germany announced new regulations and said all crypto holders that hang onto their digital assets for more than a year won't pay taxes.

## Highlights

- Germany announced new regulations and said all crypto holders that hang onto their digital assets for more than a year won't pay taxes on their digital stashes.
- The move comes by way of new tax regulations Germanyâ€™s lawmakers have implemented.
- The new rules came about in a 24-page document that details consultations that took place with stakeholders across 16 separate counties within the nation.
- The rules will not apply to all measures or tokens contained within the digital currency space.
- Some transactions will still be subject to tax reporting requirements for those who earn in crypto or earn a job where they earn digital assets will be subjected to taxation upon trading those assets in or engaging in transactions.
- But EU policy expert Patrick Hansen said Germany is in line to boost crypto adoption throughout Europe.
