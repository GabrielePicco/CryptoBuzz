The fund's shares would trade under the ticker \"ETH\" and closely track the price of Ethereum.

## Highlights

- BlackRock has filed a proposal for an exchange-traded fund for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
- The fund's shares would trade under the ticker "ETH" and closely track the price of the asset held by the trust.
- The filing comes as BlackRock also registered a trust for the cryptocurrency in Delaware, a move analysts saw as a precursor to applying for regulatory approval of an ETF.
- The price of ETH jumped 10 percent following the news, blowing past $2,100, a threshold not seen since April.
- ETH is now up more than 30% for the month, and a solid 85% up over one year ago.
