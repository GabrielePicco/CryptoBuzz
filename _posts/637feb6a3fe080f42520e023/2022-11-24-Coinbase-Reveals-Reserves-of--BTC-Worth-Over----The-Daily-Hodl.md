Crypto exchange giant Coinbase is revealing the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) in its reserves in a bid to be more transparent following the downfall of collapsed rival FTX.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin CEO Brian Armstrong says the largest US-based crypto exchange platform holds about 2 million BTC, which translates to $33.12 billion at Bitcoin’s current price of $16,561.
- Armstrong: “If you see FUD [fear, uncertainty, and doubt] out there – remember, our financials are public (we’re a public company.)
- We hold ~2 million BTC.
- ~$39.9 billion worth as of 9/30” Armstrong voiced support for the idea of verifying the solvency of crypto exchanges using Merkle tree and zk-SNARK (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge)
