FTX's investment was double the net worth of Farmington State Bank, the 26th-smallest bank in the US, which is based in a rural farming town.

## Highlights

- FTX bought $11.5 million stake in Farmington State Bank, the 26th-smallest bank in America out of 4,800.
- The bank is based in the small town of Farmington in the rural farming region of Whitman County, Washington.
- With a net worth of $5.7 million, FTX's stake was worth more than double the bank's previous net worth.
- The town has just 146 residents, and is so small that Google Street View doesn't cover the whole town.
- Questions are being asked over how FTX got federal approval to buy its stake in the bank.
- Banking veterans said it was hard to believe regulators would have knowingly allowed the crypto firm to do so.
