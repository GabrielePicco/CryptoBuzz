Crypto can act as protection against inflation, but not until it establishes its fundamentals and achieves mass adoption.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) should serve as a hedge against inflation, but investors aren’t treating it that way.
- Instead, the cryptocurrency market is mirroring the stock market.
- Cryptocurrency has characteristics of future value in an ecosystem that is currently struggling to establish its fundamentals.
- Mass adoption and integration need to happen before crypto can act as a bulwark against inflation.
- The majority of cryptocurrency holders see the future potential of those technologies, meaning some of their value is not currently present.
- Decentralization has been achieved by Bitcoin, but its exuberantly high energy costs remain unaddressed, and the majority of mining forces are still aggregated into a dozen mining pools.
