There are over 100k cryptocurrency users in Cuba less than three years after the country was connected to the global web.

## Highlights

- Over 100,000 Cubans are reportedly using Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to bypass punitive sanctions, according to news feeds on May 3, 2022.
- The explosion in crypto adoption comes roughly three years after it was connected to the internet, linking the once isolated and repressed country to the rest of the world.
- Cubaâ€™s Central Bank to Approve Crypto Service Providers pending final licensing from the central bank.
- The central bank will consider legal, social-economic, and individual project characteristics before issuing a license valid for one year.
- This can reduce the cost of these international transactions and generate an alternative to operations in dollars, less sensitive to the sanctions scheme.
