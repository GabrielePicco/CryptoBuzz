Bitcoin hashrate fell by 35% in the last 24 hours as several miners in the US powered off their machines due to the harsh winter storms.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin hashrate fell by 35% in 24 hours as several miners in the US powered off their machines due to the harsh winter storms in the country.
- The effects of the storms, such as power outages, also mean that Bitcoin miners have had to shut down.
- CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, Dennis Porter, noted that the network worked as designed.
- However, the hashrate appears to have picked up again and is now at 234.26 EH/s as of press time.
- Several miners are based in Texas because of its cheap power and favorable regulations.
- FutureBit founder John Stefanop said the decline in hashrate is due to highly centralized miners.
