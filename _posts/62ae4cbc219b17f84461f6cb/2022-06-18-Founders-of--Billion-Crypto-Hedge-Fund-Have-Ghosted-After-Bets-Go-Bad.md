Three Arrows Capital, founded by two high school friends, is MIA as firms scramble to assess the damage amid indications the fund has been wiped out.

## Highlights

- Three Arrows Capital co-founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies have gone silent since Monday.
- The hedge fund overleveraged itself ahead of the recent “crypto winter,” which has plagued the industry and led to a steep decline in crypto prices.
- Firms are scrambling to distance themselves from 3AC to assure customers that their funds won't go down with the ship run by the two childhood friends who suddenly found themselves wielding billions in the Wild West of emerging crypto markets.
- 3AC had bet on crypto prices going up with borrowed funds (or “leverage” to use financial speak) meaning that any gains are higher but losses hurt much more.
