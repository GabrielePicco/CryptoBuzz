The mainnet shadow fork was executed on Jan. 23 and will help test the feature before it officially launches. The Shanghai upgrade itself is slated for launch in March and is highly anticipated. There is a cap on how much can be withdrawn

## Highlights

- The mainnet shadow fork was executed on Jan.
- 23 and will help test the feature before it officially launches.
- The Shanghai upgrade itself is slated for launch in March and is highly anticipated.
- There is a cap on how much can be withdrawn, which will prevent an exodus of staked ETH.
- Developers planned to introduce additional improvements with the Shanghai upgrade, but these were set aside to prioritize unstaking of ETH.
- The network crossed 500,000 validators recently, which is a significant figure given the minimum amount required to stake is 32 ETH.
