Do Kwon has supposedly moved from Dubai to Serbia last month.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon – CEO and Co-Founder of Terraform Labs – has reportedly moved to Serbia.
- The 31-year-old crypto developer fled South Korea shortly after his project’s native token – LUNA – and algorithmic stablecoin – UST – plunged to virtually zero.
- Kwon vowed to end speculation around his mysterious location last month and invited police officers to attend his conference, but he has still not provided the promised details.
- The South Korean Ministry of Justice has requested the Serbian government's assistance in case Kwon is still there.
- Interpol also joined the hunt, issuing a red notice for him in September.
- This means that law enforcement agents worldwide should join forces
