In a recent tweet, Santiment announced the top ten altcoins based on development activities.

## Highlights

- Polkadot (DOT) is the leader, followed by kusama (KSM) and cardano (ADA) Santiment analysis looked into the number of commits each project recorded on GitHub in 30 days.
- Most listed coins seemingly recorded positive value changes except for Concordium and Decentraland, which plunged.
- The analysis method was designed to avoid taking into account actions that don’t lead to improvements, Santiment’s analysis method is designed to not take into account improvements in the development of coins that are still working on the ETH2 protocol.
- The most active coins listed by Santiment have been quite active in development.
