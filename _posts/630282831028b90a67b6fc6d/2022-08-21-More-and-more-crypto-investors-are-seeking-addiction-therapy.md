As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began to slide last winter, more and more crypto traders began to seek out therapists to help with their addiction.

- Psychologists and therapists report a surge in clients seeking treatment for crypto trading addiction.
- Patty Fiore sees clients with regret, depression, and anxiety in the last two months.
- Fiore views crypto investing as analogous to gambling in how it encourages addiction.
- Since the crash, other therapists report seeing at least 70 clients who want to talk about crypto.
- Crypto holds the promise of huge rewards but also shares the volatility of a game of chance, Fiore said.
- By obsessing over crypto, and by making or losing money on it, people were upturning social, social, and losing money, their lives changed.
