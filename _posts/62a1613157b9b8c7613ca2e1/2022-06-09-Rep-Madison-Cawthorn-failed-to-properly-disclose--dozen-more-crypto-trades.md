Cawthorn, who lost re-election last month, already faces several legal and ethical problems, including an investigation by the US House.

## Highlights

- Rep.
- Madison Cawthorn appears to have again violated a federal conflict-of-interest law by failing to properly report purchases and sales of six types of cryptocurrencies.
- The North Carolina Republican lost his congressional seat last month to a primary challenger.
- The House Committee on Ethics last month announced that it had formed a subpanel to in part investigate his financial trades.
- The value of his newly disclosed crypto trades is between $290,000 and $950,000, according to a new congressional financial disclosure.
- The young congressman also reported investing between $100,000 to $250,000 in a conservative fund â€” the SPDR S&P 500 benchmark index.
