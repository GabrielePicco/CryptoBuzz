Tesla purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in January 2021, and it now reports a $600 million loss when Bitcoin falls below $22,000 during the market crisis.

## Highlights

- Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth Bitcoin in January 2021 and cashed out about 10% of that investment in the first quarter of 2022.
- Bitcoin has lost nearly 70% of its value in just eight months.
- Tesla’s only silver lining is that its Bitcoin holdings account for only 10%  of its cash position and 0.1% of total market capitalization.
- At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $21,126.69, down from a high of $69,044.77 reached in November.
- Elon Musk has previously used the ‘diamond hands’ meme to indicate that he intends to hodl the bitcoin investment.
