Splits between U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, four people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation into the worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
- The investigation began in 2018 and is focused on compliance with U.S.
- anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, people say.
- Some of the at least half dozen federal prosecutors involved in the case believe the evidence already gathered justifies moving aggressively against the exchange and filing criminal charges against individual executives including founder Changpeng Zhao.
- Binance's defense attorneys have held meetings in recent months with Justice Department officials, the four people said.
- No final charging decisions have been made, though prosecutors consider Zhao and some other executives to be subjects of the investigation, one source said.
