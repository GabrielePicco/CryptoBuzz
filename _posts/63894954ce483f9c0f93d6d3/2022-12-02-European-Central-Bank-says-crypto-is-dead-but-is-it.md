The ECB has also declared that bitcoin's recent rally is nothing more than a last gasp before it slips into irrelevance.

## Highlights

- The European Central Bank has released its strongest bearish statement on crypto to date.
- In a blog post on its website, the bank chastises the EU Commission for legitimizing the industry with new regulations and predicts the death of bitcoin.
- The ECB has also declared that bitcoin's recent rally is nothing more than a last gasp before it slips into irrelevance.
- Since 2010, there have been at least 466 obituaries to bitcoin published in the press.
- The European Commission presented a comprehensive framework called Markets In Crypto-Assets (MICA) to the European Parliament earlier this year.
- The framework will force stablecoin issuers to hold 1:1 currency reserves and will also highly regulate exchanges.
