The founder of Animoca Brands told Bloomberg that his company and Web3's goal is to strip power from major tech giants.

## Highlights

- Yat Siu, cofounder and chairman of Animoca Brands, told Bloomberg that his company and Web3's goal is to strip power from Big Tech.
- He called the likes of Meta and Microsoft as "digital dictatorships" without saying more in the interview.
- Web3 is, in theory, the future of the internet that will live on the blockchain, the same backbone supporting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
- The idea is that since people's data would theoretically be decentralized, that would weaken our reliance on the large companies currently dominating the space.
- The company has invested in more than 340 firms spanning finance, gaming, and blockchain projects, Siu said.
