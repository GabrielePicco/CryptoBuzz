FTX's new CEO described the \"massive scramble for information\" as liquidators looked to secure customers' passwords and crypto wallets.

## Highlights

- John J. Ray III, the current FTX CEO, berated the crypto exchange's security.
- He told a Monday court hearing that an exec could download $500m of crypto and walk away unchecked.
- Ray also described his first 48 hours in charge of FTX as "pure hell" due to the chaos.
- FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, weeks after its then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried insulted rival crypto CEO Changpeng Zhao.
- The federal agency said allegations of "fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, and mismanagement" are "too important to be left to an internal investigation" FTX lawyers said the company ran out of assets partly because executives had a $65 billion line of credit.
