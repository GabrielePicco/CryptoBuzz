The v2 coin is still low from the presale. I would encourage anyone looking to invest in a low MC with a time tested DEV to take a look and fill a bag.

## Highlights

- I would encourage anyone looking to invest in a low MC with a time tested DEV to take a look and fill a bag while the v2 coin is still low from the presale.
- This has been a great community project and Iâ€™ve been very happy to be a part of it.
- #DOGCOINARMY    is still a great project and has been very successful with the community project.
- V2 coin will be available in the next week for pre-sale at $0.99 ($1.99) and the next day for $1,500 ($1,300) at the end of the sale.
