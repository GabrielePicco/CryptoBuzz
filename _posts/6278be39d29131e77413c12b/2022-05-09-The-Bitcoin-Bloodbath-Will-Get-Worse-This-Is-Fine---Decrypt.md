The current crypto and tech market carnage will probably get worse—but don't take your eyes off the big picture.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin is down over 8% this week and has fallen nearly 50% from last year's all-time-high.
- The crypto industry itself has become a bubble waiting to pop, says Roberts.
- Roberts: The current crypto and tech market carnage will probably get worse but don't take your eyes off the big picture.
- Roberts predicts the next era of Web3 will feature low gas fees, easy-to-use Layer 2 options, and NFTs moving to the core of the music and entertainment industries.
- It's a fun future to imagine—provided you have the stomach to get through another Crypto-Boomy weekend column from Roberts and Roberts.
