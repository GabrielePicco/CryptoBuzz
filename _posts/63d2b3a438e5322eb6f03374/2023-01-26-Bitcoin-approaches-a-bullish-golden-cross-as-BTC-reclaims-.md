Bitcoin's (BTC) rally seems to have stagnated below the $23,000 level as investors attempt to predict the next price movement.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's (BTC) rally seems to have stagnated below the $23,000 level.
- Bitcoin is on the verge of a potential golden cross formation pattern, as the 50-day moving average (MA) approaches crossing above the 200-day MA.
- The golden cross is mostly a bullish indicator that suggests that the short-term trend of Bitcoin is shifting upward and could potentially lead to a sustained rally.
- The market is likely watching this potential pattern as it could signal the start of a new bull market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies amid uncertainty regarding the general health of the digital assets market.
- On the flip side, Bitcoinâ€™s fortunes remain in limbo, with the maiden cryptocurrency starting at the dreaded death cross.
