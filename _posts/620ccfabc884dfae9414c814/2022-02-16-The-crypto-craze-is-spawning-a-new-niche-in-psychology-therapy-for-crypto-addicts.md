As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began to slide last winter, more and more crypto traders began to seek out therapists to help with their addiction.

## Highlights

- Psychologists and therapists report a surge in clients seeking treatment for crypto trading addiction.
- Patty Fiore, a psychoanalyst, sees clients in the last two months.
- Fiore's first client came in 2020 not as an investor but as an employee of a company working on a coin offering.
- She views crypto investing as analogous to gambling in how it encourages addiction.
- Other therapists report seeing at least 70 clients who want to talk about crypto in the past four years, Peter Klein, a London-based therapist, has gotten 30-40 inquiries since the crash.
- It's like gambling, but also shares the volatility of a game of chance, Fiore said.
