In what is arguably the largest mass onboarding event to the Web3 space in its history, Reddit has delivered some impressive figures.

## Highlights

- Reddit’s Collectible Avatars generated $2.54 million in sales from October 23 to the 24 hours, according to public blockchain data compiled by Dune user polygon_analytics.
- This represents an increase of more than 1,000 percent in sales volume from the previous day.
- The feat is difficult to overstate, especially because it originated from a Web2 social platform whose dislike of NFTs in its own community was well-known.
- Reddit is now firmly in the Web3 space now, and it pulled off a miracle in turning its NFT-averse community into an avid collector base in the process.
- The company has previously partnered with Riot Games and is rumored to be in talks with The Sandbox
