## Highlights

- I revel in people losing money on NFTs and crypto.
- The S&P 500 averages a 10.5% return annually.
- If you use your real money to buy fake money or JPEGs of monkeys, I am actively rooting for you to lose it all.
- And then the Bitcoin shills will turn around and tell you, "This is the time to buy more."
- Keep in mind, they're talking about a currency that has an unidentified founder who owns 5 percent of all the Bitcoin that exists and that you can't actually use to buy anything.
