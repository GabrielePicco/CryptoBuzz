Celsius made headlines a month ago after freezing customer accounts, blaming \"extreme market conditions.\"

## Highlights

- Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week.
- The firm was one of the largest players in the crypto lending space with $8 billion in loans to clients.
- Celsius said it had 1.7 million customers as of June and was competing with its interest-bearing accounts and yields as high as 17%.
- Six state regulators have already launched investigations into Celsius.
- Celsius made headlines a month ago after freezing customer accounts, blaming "extreme market conditions" The firm would lend customers' crypto out to counterparties willing to pay a sky-high interest rate to borrow it.
- Celsius would then split some of that revenue with users, but the structure came crashing down.
