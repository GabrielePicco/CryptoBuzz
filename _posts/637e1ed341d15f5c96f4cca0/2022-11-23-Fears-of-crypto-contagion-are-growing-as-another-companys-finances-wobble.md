After the collapse of FTX, many are wondering if another cryptocurrency platform called Genesis will fall next.

## Highlights

- Fears of crypto contagion are growing as another company's finances wobble.
- Fears that the collapse of FTX will lead to more destruction in the crypto industry are hitting almost every investor in the U.S.
- Fears have not been realized, but Genesis has reportedly warned potential investors it may need to file for bankruptcy if it fails to quickly raise a significant chunk of cash - $1 billion, Bloomberg News reports.
- "Crypto contagion" is a real possibility in the decentralized system of digital currencies, where there are few investor protections in place, and companies can be tangled up with one another in unclear ways.
- FTX and its 100-plus affiliates around the world had deep ties with other companies.
