CoinDesk reported Wednesday that Do Kwon, co-founder and chief executive of the development firm behind the Terra blockchain, was closely involved with an earlier stablecoin effort that failed to gain traction.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon, co-founder and chief executive of the development firm behind the Terra blockchain, was closely involved with an earlier stablecoin effort that failed to gain traction.
- Basis Cash was an Ethereum-based stablecoin that aimed to revive an algorithmic stablecoin concept known as Basis.
- Kwon was one of two pseudonymous co-founders, going by the moniker Rick Sanchez, a reference to the adult cartoon show Rick and Morty.
- The disclosure is significant given the turbulence around TerraUSD (UST) that has seen its value fall significantly in recent days.
- As of the time of writing, UST is trading at roughly $0.54 after reaching an all-time low.
