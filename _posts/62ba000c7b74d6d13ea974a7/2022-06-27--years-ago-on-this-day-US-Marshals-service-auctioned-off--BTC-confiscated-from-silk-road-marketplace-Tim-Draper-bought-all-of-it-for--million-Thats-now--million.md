Venture capitalist Tim Draper, sole winner of an auction last week of 30,000 bitcoins by the U.S. Marshals Service, called the sale a vote of confidence by the government in the nascent crypto-currency.

## Highlights

- Venture capitalist Tim Draper won auction of 30,000 bitcoins by U.S.
- Marshals Service last week.
- The well-known Silicon Valley investor partnered with Palo Alto-based Vaurum, which facilitates over-the-counter bitcoin trading, for the sale.
- The bitcoins, a virtual currency that is ‘mined” by computers solving complex algorithms, were seized last year.
- Acceptance of bitcoin has been growing as more merchants allow customers to pay for goods and services with the currency.
- The success gives the virtual currency more legitimacy as a means of exchange, but the success gives it more legitimacy in the hands of the public.
