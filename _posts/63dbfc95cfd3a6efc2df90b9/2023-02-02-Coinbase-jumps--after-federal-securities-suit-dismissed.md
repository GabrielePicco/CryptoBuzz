A federal suit against Coinbase was dismissed Wednesday, with a judge ruling against claims that it conducted unregistered securities offerings.

## Highlights

- A Manhattan federal judge dismisses a class-action suit against the cryptocurrency exchange.
- The suit was filed in October 2021 and implicated Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong as the primary "control person" at the exchange.
- It comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler aggressively pursues actions in the crypto space in part by arguing they represent securities offerings.
- The company declined to comment on the ruling, but shares jumped overnight and were up over 20% midmorning Thursday.
- The judge dismissed the federal claims with prejudice, citing the dismissal of another crypto class action against Binance, citing a judge ruling against claims that it conducted unregistered securities offerings.
