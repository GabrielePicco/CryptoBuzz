LimeWire has announced that it will use the Algorand blockchain to power its blockchain collectibles marketplace.

## Highlights

- LimeWire has announced that it will use the Algorand blockchain to power its digital collectibles marketplace.
- The digital music brand will mint its NFTs and collectibles on the blockchain, and that a token will also be launched later this year.
- LimeWire's NFT store will feature music-related media, but its custom token will serve various functions by providing access to community features, voting rights, and rewards.
- It is unclear whether LimeWireâ€™s marketplace will be able to compete with larger marketplaces like OpenSea.
- Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, AlgorAnd does not rely on the energy-intensive process of Proof-of-Stake mining.
