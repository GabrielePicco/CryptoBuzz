## Highlights

- ETH rose more than 11% in the past 24 hours amid a broader crypto market rally prompted by the Fed’s new interest rate hike announced Wednesday.
- Vitalik Buterin said the upcoming Merge is not priced yet and will not be “until after it happens,” he said.
- At the time of writing, ETH stood at around $1,618.98, after surging more than 35% in past month.
- The key resistance remains at $2,400 where the descending trend line that connects two prior peaks currently comes in.
- This would mark the first time ETH has returned to trade above $2k since the end of May.
