Sullivan's blog post criticizing PoS is a month old, but Dorsey's timing couldn't have been better.

## Highlights

- Jack Dorsey's latest tweet did not sit well with the Cardano creator, Charles Hoskinson, who said the Merge will kick off an “era” where all proof-of-stake networks will be unfairly categorized as being similar to that of Bitcoin.
- Hoskinson believes in a potential narrative war between the two apex cryptocurrencies and that the “Bitcoiners” should be prepared to hit back in such as scenario.
- Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus assured Hoskinson that the majority of users in the space are not aware of the workings behind PoS and PoW mechanisms, even as many pretend to do so.
