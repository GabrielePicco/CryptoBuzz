The ‘Blockchain Eight’ wrote a bipartisan letter in March attempting to chill the SEC’s information requests to crypto firms. FTX was one of those firms.

## Highlights

- The Prospect confirms that FTX was one of the firms receiving information requests from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
- A bipartisan group of congressmen sent a letter to the SEC in March asking them to slow down an investigation into the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange.
- Five of the eight members received campaign donations from FTX employees, ranging from $2,900 to $11,600.
- Some of the members of the “Blockchain Eight’s” have benefited from crypto largesse.
- FTX has been portrayed as a Democratic firm, thanks to the high profile of former co-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, with a shade over 50 percent going directly to congressional Republicans.
