The former Alameda hedge fund CEO pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in an agreement signed on Monday.

## Highlights

- Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in an agreement signed on Monday.
- The former Alameda hedge fund CEO, 28, was facing up to 110 years in prison before she agreed to cooperate with the federal government.
- Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang had agreed to “cooperate fully” with the feds, in exchange for which they will likely get much lighter sentences.
- The amount of prison time Ellison has agreed to serve will not be announced until after she has finished co-operating, likely once Bankman-Fried’s trial has concluded.
- Ellison is still on the line for financial damages and has also been separately sued by the government.
