#FeatureByJT | Pulse Nigeria

## Highlights

- Small retail payments across Africa are helping to drive crypto adoption and usage, with African countries posting the worldâ€™s highest proportion of crypto retail payments.
- Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for the lowest transaction volume of any region at just 2% of global activity.
- Africa presents a uniquely prosperous environment for entrepreneurs in the sector.
- There is an urgent need for regulators to respond to this new technology, particularly as it becomes more prevalent.
- Currently, only around one-quarter of the countries in Sub-Sahara Africa formally regulate cryptocurrencies.
- The need for regulation is even greater given how volatile and decentralized cryptocurrencies are, which poses challenges for regulators and policymakers alike.
