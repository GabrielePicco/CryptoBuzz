Top cryptocurrency prices and charts, listed by market capitalization. Free access to current and historic data for Bitcoin and thousands of altcoins.

## Highlights

- CoinMarketCap.com provides up-to-date cryptocurrency prices, charts and data about the emerging cryptocurrency markets.
- At the time of writing, we estimate that there are around 8,000 coins, tokens and projects in the global coin market.
- We have a vetting process that each coin goes through before it is listed on the site.
- If we suspect that a coin or project is a scam, it does not get listed.
- The site does not list all of the cryptocurrencies listed on our site, but we are aware that not all coins and projects have good intentions, and we are very aware not all of them are good intentions.
- We provide Live and Historic Crypto Charts for Free.
