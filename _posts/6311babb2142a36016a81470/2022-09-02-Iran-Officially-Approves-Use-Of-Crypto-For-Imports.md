The Middle Eastern country recently approved using cryptocurrencies as a payment means for business imports.

## Highlights

- Iran recently approved using cryptocurrencies as a payment means for business imports.
- The approval is a part of a broader set of crypto regulatory framework the country has enacted.
- Iranâ€™s Deputy Minister of Trade said the use of crypto in foreign trade would be widespread in the country by the end of September.
- The move comes three weeks after the country placed its first import order funded with cryptocurrency.
- With this move, the government will be looking to regulate the cryptocurrency industry within the country further to push adoption of the digital assets.
- Hopefully, these regulations will also address the country's antagonism towards crypto mining.
