Under Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy accumulated 130,00 Bitcoins and now the company's financial health depends on this $3.4 billion gamble.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's dip to $18,300 on 13 October may have temporarily jeopardized MicroStrategy’s financial health.
- The software company accumulated 130,000 Bitcoins, worth just over $3.406 Billion at current rates.
- Michael Saylor is popular in the crypto community and is often seen making the case for Bitcoin.
- Saylor's first debt repayment is due in 17 months, where Saylor will be required to pay $855 Million.
- The company's core software business is generating very little cash flow, and its Bitcoin interest loan payments may negatively affect its cash flow.
- However, with a market capitalization of $2.2 billion, the company boasts an impressive ratio when compared to its modest annualized free cash flow
