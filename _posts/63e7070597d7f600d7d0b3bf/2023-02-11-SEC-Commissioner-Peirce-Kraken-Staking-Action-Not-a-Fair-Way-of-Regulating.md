Hester Peirce voiced her dissent on the latest action against Kraken, saying that the industry needs clear rules not “one-off enforcement.”

## Highlights

- The Securities and Exchange Commission announced its enforcement action against Kraken, forcing the crypto exchange to shut down its staking-as-a-service in the U.S.
- and pay a $30 million fine.
- Commissioner Hester Peirce, known in the industry as ‘Crypto Mom,” voiced her dissent to the SEC’s action, calling it “not an efficient or fair way of regulating” an emerging industry.
- It is still unclear whether other American companies will be affected by the SEC's action, though it is not clear if other exchanges will also be affected.
- The SEC's decision was not unanimous, however.
