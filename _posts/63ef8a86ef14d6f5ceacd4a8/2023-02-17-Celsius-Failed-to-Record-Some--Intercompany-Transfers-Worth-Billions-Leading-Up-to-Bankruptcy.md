A lack of record-keeping could make it impossible to \"fully reconstruct\" the bankrupt crypto lender's multi-billion dollar intercompany claim, court filings show.

## Highlights

- A lack of record-keeping could make it impossible to "fully reconstruct" the bankrupt crypto lender's multi-billion dollar intercompany claim, court filings show.
- A forensic accounting firm would likely need to manually reconstruct every intercompany transaction at a significant cost to the Debtorsâ€™ estates.
- "Given the dearth of record keeping, it may not be possible to fully reconstruct the intercompany Claim," the statement said.
- If it were at all possible, it would be a time and cost intensive forensic accounting exercise that would likely require the engagement of a Forensic accounting firm to reconstruct all intercompany transactions, the statement says.
