The UFC’s decision to promote blockchain technologies during a market crash raises a variety of concerns.

## Highlights

- The UFC announced a marketing partnership with VeChain, the public network utilized across different supply chains.
- The deal is reportedly valued at nearly $100 million.
- VeChain debuted in the Octagon at UFC 275 in Singapore, one of the first numbered Pay-Per-View events to take place in Southeast Asia.
- The UFC first got into the blockchain business in 2020 when it partnered with Dapper Labs to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of video moments.
- The MMA organization then partnered with Chiliz, a leading digital currency and blockchain provider for sports and entertainment industries, in May 2021, and announced plans to launch a $UFC Fan Token.
