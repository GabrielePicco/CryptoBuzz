FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried believes that larger crypto companies should help stem losses in times of industry recession.

## Highlights

- FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried says he has a'responsibility' to bail out ailing crypto companies.
- FTX helped Liquid Group with a $120 million loan to recuperate losses from a $90 million attack that happened when Liquidâ€™s digital wallets were compromised.
- Bitcoin has since recovered, though at its current price of $20,600, it's still well below half the value it started the year at.
- The 30-year-old added that, "Even if we weren't the ones who caused it, or weren't involved in it, I want to do what can help it grow and thrive"
