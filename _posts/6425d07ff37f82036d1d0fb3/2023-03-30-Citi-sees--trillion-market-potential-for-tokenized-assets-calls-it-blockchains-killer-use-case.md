Momentum on the adoption of blockchain technology has positively shifted, say researchers at Citi.

## Highlights

- Citi: Up to $4 trillion in tokenized digital securities and up to $5 trillion of central bank digital currency could be circulating in major economies in the world.
- The space is approaching an inflection point, say researchers at Citi say.
- The potential for tokenization via blockchain technology has been touted for some time now, but it's not quite at the point of mass adoption, says Citi's Kathleen Boyle.
- Mainstream adoption requires enablers including, decentralized digital identities, zero-knowledge proofs, Oracles, and secure bridges, she says.
- BlackRock's Larry Fink wrote about the potential of the underlying technologies in digital assets in his annual letter to shareholders earlier this month.
