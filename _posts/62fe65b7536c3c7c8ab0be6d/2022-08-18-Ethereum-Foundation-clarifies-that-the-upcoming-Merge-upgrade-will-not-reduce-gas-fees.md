\"The Merge is ... not an expansion of network capacity, and will not result in lower gas fees,\" – Ethereum Foundation.

## Highlights

- The "Merge" is not an expansion of network capacity, says the Ether Foundation.
- Gas fees are a product of network demand relative to the network's capacity, the foundation says.
- The upgrade is expected to land within the third or final quarter of 2022.
- Post-Merge APR yields on the network are expected to increase by 50% compared to now to attract capital, but APR yields will also increase 50%.
- The Merge deprecates the use of proof-of-work, transitioning to proof of-stake for consensus, but does not significantly change any parameters that directly influence network capacity or throughput, the Ethereum Foundation says.
