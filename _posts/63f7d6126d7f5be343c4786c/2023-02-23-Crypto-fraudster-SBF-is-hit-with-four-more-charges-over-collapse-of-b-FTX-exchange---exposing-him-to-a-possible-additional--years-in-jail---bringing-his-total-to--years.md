Court documents released on Thursday see Bankham-Fried charged with 12 offences, which now include bank fraud and making more than 300 illegal political donations.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried has been hit with four more brank fraud charges in a new indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court on Thursday.
- The new charges include bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitter.
- The 30-year-old was first charged in December with eight criminal counts and was subsequently extradited from the Bahamas.
- His trial has been set for October 2023 and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
- He was already facing 115 years in prison, the new charges could bring an additional 40 years, if he is convicted on all charges, and he is accused of having a messiah complex and presenting himself as a'savior' while boasting about FTX profits.
