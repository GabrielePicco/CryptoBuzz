Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong on Wednesday termed Sam Bankman-Fried, the beleaguered

## Highlights

- Brian Armstrong calls Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, a “criminal” He slammed a Wall Street Journal report on him as being a ‘puff piece” Armstrong said this was a turning point in citizen journalism.
- The Coinbase CEO had criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to create a clear regulatory framework which, according to him, led to American investors fleeing to exchanges outside the country.
- The problem is that the SEC failed to create regulatory clarity here in the US, so many American investors (and 95% of trading activity) went offshore.
- Punishing US companies for this makes no sense, he said.
