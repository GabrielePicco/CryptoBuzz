Creators sound the alarm after the marketplace reveals its plans, which include blacklisting rivals and potentially optional royalties.

## Highlights

- Top NFT marketplace OpenSea has announced its plans for NFT creator royalties.
- The move comes amid a growing trend of rival marketplaces not honoring NFT royalties.
- In a Twitter thread, OpenSea shared what it called a “thoughtful, principled approach” to the issue.
- The company said it is still considering what to do about existing NFT projects, and that it will garner additional community feedback.
- After that date, the marketplace will make a decision, which could ultimately include making royalty fee payments optional for traders, as some other marketplaces have done.
- But many prominent Web3 creators say the plan is misleading and anti-competitive.
