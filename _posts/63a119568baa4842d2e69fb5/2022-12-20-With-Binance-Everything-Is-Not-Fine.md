As the financial health of the exchange grows more uncertain, CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao has offered nothing but red flags, says Genevieve Roch-Decter (CFA), the CEO of GRIT Capital.

## Highlights

- CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao has offered nothing but red flags, says GRIT Capital CEO Genevieve Roch-Decter.
- CZ told CNBC's "Squawk Box" anchors that, in fact, a “good chunk” of that payment was received in FTT – which is now aggressively less valuable than an IOU – and that up until recently he had “actually forgot” about some $580 million FTT that Binance had left over from the transaction.
- Binance CEO CZ said in an interview this week that he had forgotten about that $580M FTT had been left over.
