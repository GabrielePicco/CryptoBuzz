A federal judge ordered Sam Bankman-Fried back to court this week after learning that the founder of crypto trading platform FTX accessed the internet in a way the government can't track.

## Highlights

- Bankman-Fried is under house arrest at his parents’ home in Palo Alto, Calif.
- He is released on a $250 million bond while awaiting trial on fraud and conspiracy charges.
- Prosecutors alerted the judge to his use of a VPN in late January and early February.
- The judge previously expressed concern over Bankman’s use of encryption and whether the government could track what he was doing while out on bail.
- The former so-called Crypto King used a virtual private network, or VPN, twice in the past month, including days after the judge expressed concern about the use of encrypted messaging apps.
- He is accused of using an NFL Game Pass international subscription to watch NFL playoff and Super Bowl games.
