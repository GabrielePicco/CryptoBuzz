Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution Arbitrum has launched a second chain, Arbitrum Nova, and announced a partnership with Reddit.

## Highlights

- Arbitrum Nova is optimized for high-transaction volume use cases like gaming and social projects.
- The Layer 2 project’s developer Offchain Labs announced the updates in a Tuesday press release.
- The new chain is an entirely new chain, completely different from Arbitrum One, which launched last year.
- The developer has also partnered with Reddit to onboard its community points system to the new network.
- The initiative marks the first major deployment on the new chain and the launch marks a “major milestone” of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
- It leverages Optimistic Rollup technology to increase throughput and process transactions off the base chain.
