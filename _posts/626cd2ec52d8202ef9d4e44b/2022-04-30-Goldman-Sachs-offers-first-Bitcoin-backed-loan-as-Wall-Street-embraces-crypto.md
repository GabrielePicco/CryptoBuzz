Goldman Sachs has officially offered its first Bitcoin-backed loan, showing a significant step forward for institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space.

## Highlights

- Goldman Sachs has offered its first Bitcoin-backed loan, in a major step forward for institutional cryptocurrency adoption on Wall Street.
- Such a loan allows for a Bitcoin holder to borrow fiat currency such as the U.S.
- dollar by fronting up to their BTC as collateral to the bank.
- The underlying volatility of Bitcoin makes these loans risky â€” if the price of Bitcoin drops too far, the borrower may be required to increase their collateral.
- Goldman Sachs is not alone in its foray into digital assets, with fellow Wall Street banks ramping up their movements into the cryptocurrency space as well.
- On Wednesday, multi-trillion-dollar asset management firm BlackRock announced the launch of a blockchain-focused exchange-traded fund.
