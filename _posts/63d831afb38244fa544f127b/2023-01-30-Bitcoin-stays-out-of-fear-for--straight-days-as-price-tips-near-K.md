While debate surrounds whether the current BTC price rally is a breakthrough or a bull trap, market sentiment has skyrocketed to levels not seen since BTC was about $65,000, in November 2021.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) has just clocked its 11th consecutive day outside the “Fear” zone in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, cementing its longest streak out of fear since last March.
- Bitcoin sentiment is currently sitting firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone with a score of 61, its highest level since the height of the bull run around Nov.
- 16, 2021, when its price was about $65,000.
- However, market participants continue to debate whether the recent price surge is part of a bull trap or whether there is a real chance for a bull run.
- According to data from blockchain intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, 64% of Bitcoin investors are now in profit.
