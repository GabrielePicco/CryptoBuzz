Read now to learn how Bitcoin's energy use helps defines its value and how Bitcoin would be worthless without it.

## Highlights

- The European Union’s parliament voted on language within its pending legislative framework governing digital assets, “Markets in Crypto Assets” The proposed language read as follows: Digital assets shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union.Thankfully, the EU parliament voted against the measure, but Bitcoin is still safe, for now.
- Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralized network that doesn’t even require the internet in order to work.
- The issuance rate of new Bitcoin halves around every four years and is set to completely stop around the year 2140.
