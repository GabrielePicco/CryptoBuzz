Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin is expressing his concerns with Elon Musk's new Twitter policies and wave of sudden account bans.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin is raising alarms on Twitter's recent wave of account bans over the last few days.
- He says the site’s policies are “seeming to retrofit around Elon's views on very specific situations.” The latest wave of censorship concerns began when Musk banned the account @ElonJets and @CelebJets, which tracks the private jets of various celebrities.
- Musk then implemented a new Twitter policy that bans any “any tweets or accounts that share someone's live location,” with the only exceptions being in relation to “a crisis situation to assist with humanitarian efforts.”
