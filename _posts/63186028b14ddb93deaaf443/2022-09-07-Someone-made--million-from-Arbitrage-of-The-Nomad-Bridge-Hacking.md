Following the big hack comes significant arbitrage opportunities. And some guys benefited A LOT from them.

## Highlights

- The $190 million hacking shocked the community and proved Vitalik’s “I told you so” But seldom noticed the following arbitrages’ double damage.
- EigenPhi is the first to report the humongous transactions done by searchers.
- In total, we estimate about $6 million has been taken out from the hacking as revenue for the searchers, out of which $4.5 million was possible profit.
- The huge exchange rate spread of WETH/WBTC created a once-in-a-lifetime arbitrage window.
- These searches must have some highly sophisticated systems monitoring all the liquidity pools or clairvoyant power foreseeing the future.
