The SEC's language about FTX's token FTT in its charges against two former FTX execs show its heightened aggression toward crypto exchanges.

## Highlights

- SEC appears to be escalating its assault on crypto assets as a whole.
- Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, an FTX co-founder, are accused of manipulating the price of FTT.
- The SEC has charged Ellison and Wang with securities fraud for offering FTT as an unregistered security.
- If the SEC can get courts to agree that crypto tokens like FTT are securities regardless of how they are offered, the agency would be able to go after more than just the projects that create those tokens.
- In such a scenario, major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance would be exposed to immense legal liability, and either permitted to participate in crypto-wary registered exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, or shut down.
