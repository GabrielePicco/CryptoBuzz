The techniques have evolved to sidestep Binance's highly publicized know-your-customer controls, and focus on obscuring a user's country of origin.

## Highlights

- Binance is the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, handling $490 billion of spot trading volumes in March 2022.
- Binance founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao has touted the exchange's know-your-customer systems, known as KYC, as a billion-dollar effort.
- But customers in China and around the world regularly subvert Binance's controls to hide their country of residence or origin, messages in official Chinese-language chatrooms show.
- Some techniques involve forging bank documents or offering false addresses, others involve simple manipulation of the systems.
- The techniques also call into question the effectiveness of Bance's anti-money-laundering efforts.
