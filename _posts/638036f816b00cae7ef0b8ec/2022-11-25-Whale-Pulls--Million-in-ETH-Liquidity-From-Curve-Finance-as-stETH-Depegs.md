A whale drained 84,131.76 ETH from Curve Finance, causing stETH to depeg to 0.9671 ETH as stakers prepare for a withdrawal testnet.

## Highlights

- A whale removed 84,131.76 ETH from DeFi protocol Curve Finance, causing stETH to depeg to 0.9671 ETH.
- The price of stETH dropped sharply to $0.9673 ETH, but has since recovered slightly to $1.9790 ETH.
- Depegging could concern users who plan to withdraw their stETH from the Ethereum blockchain after it undergoes the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.
- While staked ETH is supposed to be redeemable 1:1 for ETH, its price depends on the forces of supply and demand in the markets it trades in.
- The depegging can also cause severe problems for those who use the stETH as collateral for borrowing in decentralized finance.
