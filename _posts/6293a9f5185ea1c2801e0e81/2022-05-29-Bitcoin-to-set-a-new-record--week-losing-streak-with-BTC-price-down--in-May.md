Bitcoin prepares for a record ninth straight week of losses while BTC price action stays paralyzed.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) threatened to continue an unprecedented losing streak on May 29 as BTC/USD stayed in a right intraday range.
- Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView flagged the largest cryptocurrency heading for nine weeks of downtrend in a row â€” the most in history.
- Even stock markets, troubled by central bank tightening, managed to put in gains over the week, while Bitcoin and the majority of altcoins added to losses.
- This would make May 2022 the second worst May in Bitcoin's history, data from on-chain monitoring resource Coinglass confirmed.
- The longest-ever such downtrend occurred in 2014-15 and lasted more than twice as long.
