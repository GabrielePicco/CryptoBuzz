The Ethereum standard ERC-4804 was introduced in early March, bringing with it a new Web3 URL standard that does away with HTTP.

## Highlights

- ERC-4804, dubbed Web3 URL to EVM Call Message Translation, was approved and finalized on the mainnet on March 1.
- It allows users to directly access on-chain Web3 content, such as decentralized applications (DApps) front-ends and NFTs.
- The new standard would be useful for DApps or websites at risk of censorship, with Tornado Cash as an example.
- Anthurine Xiang, a spokesperson for layer-2 storage protocol ETHStorage, explained that in many cases, the ecosystem still relies on centralized web servers to access “decentralized” apps such as Uniswap.
- Xiang: “Not everything needs to go decentralized.
- If you are running a pretty good Web2 business and you don’t have to worry too
