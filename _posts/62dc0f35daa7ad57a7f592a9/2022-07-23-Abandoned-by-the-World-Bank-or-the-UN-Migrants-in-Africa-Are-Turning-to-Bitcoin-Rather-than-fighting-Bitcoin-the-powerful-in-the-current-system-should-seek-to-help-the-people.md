Rather than fighting Bitcoin, the powerful in the current system should seek to help the people.

## Highlights

- A report by the World Bank in May 2022 indicated that remittances would reach $630B in 2022 with obvious record flows in Ukraine.
- Sub-Saharan Africa emerges once again as the most expensive region to send funds to.
- African migrants are using Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to remit funds to send money to relatives back home.
- The development of P2P platforms in Africa is also explained by the fact that more and more countries have sought to make it more difficult to use Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies via customers' bank accounts by passing restrictive laws or pushing banks to ban such transactions.
- Even the future of Bitcoin as a large-scale payment method, the fees will be virtually non-existent.
