The proposed legislation seeks to reduce friction in the usage of bitcoin as a daily currency.

## Highlights

- A bipartisan bill would exempt bitcoin transactions from tax obligations if the associated capital gains are $200 or less.
- The bill seeks to incentivize the digital currency’s usage as a medium of exchange in the U.S.
- Currently, any gain obtained from the sale of cryptocurrency must be reported as a taxable income regardless of the size or purpose of the transaction.
- The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act was co-authored by Rep.
- David Schweikert and co-sponsored by Representatives Darren Soto and Tom Emmer.
- “Virtual currency is reshaping our everyday lives, and the United States needs to recognize this and work to treat these currencies fairly in our tax code”
