Donations to the Ukrainian army in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are in the millions of dollars, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.

## Highlights

- Data shows that $4.1 million in crypto has been raised by nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups in Ukraine since the invasion began.
- On Thursday alone, one NGO received over $675,000 in bitcoin, and by Friday morning, that number had ballooned to more than $3.4 million thanks to that one-off $3 million donation.
- The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has made it clear that it won't accept crypto donations directly.
- The military welcomes donations for logistics and medial support, but those contributions have to go through fiat channels, as the government doesn't allow the military to use other payment systems such as Webmoney.
