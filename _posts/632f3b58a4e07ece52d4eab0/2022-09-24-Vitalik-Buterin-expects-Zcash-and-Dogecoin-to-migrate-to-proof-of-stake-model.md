Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expects proof-of-work blockchains like Zcash and Dogecoin to transition to proof-of-stake consensus.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin expects Zcash and Dogecoin to transition to proof-of-stake consensus.
- Zcash is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization that leverage the proof of work mode.
- Doge and Zcash have expressed interest in moving to proof of stake in separate announcements.
- In mid-2021, Electric Coin Company, the development firm behind Zcash, wrote a blog post detailing its approach and next steps toward implementing PoS.
- Still, a blockchain consensus switch is easier said than done and requires a nuanced discussion among community members on how the change may impact a network, which can be difficult to implement.
