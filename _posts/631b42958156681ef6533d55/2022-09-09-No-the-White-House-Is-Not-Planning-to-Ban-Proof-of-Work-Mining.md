A White House report on the environmental impact of Proof-of-Work mining has riled crypto fans, but the content is milder than tweets suggest.

## Highlights

- The White House released a report on the climatological impact of blockchain technology Wednesday.
- While it was widely reported that the White House wants to ban Proof-of-Work mining, the actual text of the document tells a different story.
- The report can more accurately be described as a cost-benefit analysis, with substantial attention given to the idea that the value offered by distributed ledger technology could outweigh its costs.
- It doesnâ€™t seem so, despite what many crypto enthusiasts have been saying, despite the fact that the report acknowledges that the costs are real.
- Any such ban would be a last resort, and advances in ASIC technology, migration to greener energy sources are all mentioned in the report as alternatives.
