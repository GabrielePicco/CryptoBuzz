The internet is a maelstrom of talking—even brief exposure is liable to make you wish everyone would just shut up—but does any of it matter? Does the chorus of social media critics actua

## Highlights

- Are game publishers backing away from NFTs because they don't see value in them or because they get mercilessly mocked online every time they talk about them?
- Blizzard president Mike Ybarra said that "no one is doing NFT" at the studio in April.
- Blizzard's president Mike.
- Ubisoft gave non-fungible goodies a brief try in Ghost Recon Breakpoint.
- The company now says it was all just a research project, not to be taken too seriously.
- Maybe the internet's anti-NFT rhetoric is just shoving mainstream game companies toward the perspective they would've taken anyway: Curious but cautious, especially after all the scams and thievery seen over the past couple years.
