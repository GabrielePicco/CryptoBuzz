We will continue to update our customers as we receive additional information.

## Highlights

- Gemini is a full-reserve exchange and custodian.
- All customer funds held on the Gemini exchange are held 1:1 and available for withdrawal at any time.
- We are disappointed that the Earn program SLA will not be met, but we are encouraged by Genesis’ and its parent company Digital Currency Group’s commitment to doing everything in their power to fulfill their obligations to customers.
- We will continue to work with them on behalf of all Earn customers.
- This is our highest priority.
- We greatly appreciate your patience.
