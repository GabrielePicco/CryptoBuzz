Likely a signature phishing attack from several weeks back, the attacker is exploiting now before all listings expire.

## Highlights

- Hacker is using a helper contract deployed 30 days ago, to call an OS contract deployed 4 years ago, with valid atomicMatch() data.
- Likely a signature phishing attack from several weeks back, the attacker is exploiting now before all listings expire.
- The only relation to OSâ€™ new V2 deployment is that these listing phishings will expire in six days, so the hacker is acting now to steal items listed on the V1 marketplace.
- OpenSea is already working on patching the error, but in the meantime all OpenSea users should revoke access from outside sites and transfer NFTs to new wallets.
- The hacker has been sending out a phishing email to receive access to user's OpenSea accounts.
