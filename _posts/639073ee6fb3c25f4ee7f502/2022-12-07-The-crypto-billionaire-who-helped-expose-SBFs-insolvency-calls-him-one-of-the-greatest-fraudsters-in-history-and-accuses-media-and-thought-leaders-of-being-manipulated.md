The crypto CZ is speaking out against SBF after FTX's collapse and arguing he had nothing to do with his rival's downfall.

## Highlights

- Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, is speaking out against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
- FTX, formerly the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, filed for bankruptcy in November after customers withdrew billions from the exchange in a matter of days, prompting a halt to withdrawals.
- CZ and many in the crypto community argue that talk of a “bank run” doesn’t make sense, and that SBF is simply attempting to avoid jail time by saying FTX's failure was merely a result of bad luck and outside attacks.
- The billionaire CEO also laughed off the supposed rivalry between him and SBF on Tuesday.
