Noted economist Nouriel Roubini shredded the stricken crypto industry.

## Highlights

- Economist Nouriel Roubini says FTX and its now-disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF, are not an exception.
- FTX filed for bankruptcy late in 2022, while SBF faces charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy.
- SBF became a crypto billionaire and a mainstream star in the industry by the time he was 29.
- A year later, he lost his fortune as trust and money flowed out of the crypto space, sending investors into turmoil.
- "Literally 99% of crypto is a scam.
- A total real-bubble Ponzi scheme that is going bust," the NYU professor said.
