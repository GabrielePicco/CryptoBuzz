The long and winding road Jed McCaleb took to sell off the $9 billion XRP he received as a founder of Ripple is nearing its end.

## Highlights

- Former Ripple Labs founder Jed McCaleb has 81.53 million XRP, worth $26.55 million, remaining in his walletâ€™s balance.
- McCaleb was part of the founding team of Ripple in 2012, receiving a share of 20 billion XRP.
- He left the company in 2014, taking with him his entire XRP share, which equated to around 9% of the total supply.
- He has been methodically selling off chunks of his once nine-billion-strong XRP holdings since he left in 2014.
- At the current rate of selling, his wallet may be depleted within two to three weeks, to the delight of the crypto community.
