Today I am making the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team by about 18%, to ensure we stay healthy during this economic downturn. I want to walk you through why I am making this decision…

## Highlights

- At the beginning of 2021, we had 1,250 employees.
- At the time, we were in the early innings of the bull run and adoption of crypto products was exploding.
- We saw the opportunities but we needed to massively scale our team to be positioned to compete in a broad array of bets.
- We have now exceeded the limit of how many new employees we can integrate while growing our productivity.
- We believe the targeted resourcing changes we are making today will allow our organization to become more efficient.
- All affected employees will receive an invitation to have a direct conversation with your HRBP and the senior leader of your organization.
