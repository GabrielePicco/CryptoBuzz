The Times paints a picture of a troubled businessman who made bad investments, rather than an industry built like a house of cards.

## Highlights

- FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, leaving reasonable people to wonder how a cryptocurrency platform founded in 2019, which reached a valuation of $32 billion in 2021, could plummet to zero in such a short time.
- The interview with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is presented with such a gauzy lens that you have to start wondering what the hell is going on with crypto reporting at the New York Times.
- The result isnâ€™t to illuminate the shadowy world of crypto, it reads like if the Times had conducted an interview with Bernie Madoff after his ponzi scheme collapsed and ultimately suggested he just made some bad investments.
