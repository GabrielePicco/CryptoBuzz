Large depositors could run down almost 15% of their UST position in Anchor almost immediately when the dollar-peg slip first took place.

## Highlights

- Large investors exited Terra-related positions as the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin began to lose its peg, while small investors continued buying during the collapse.
- That detail was part of a report on Terraâ€™s meltdown in early May that Jump Crypto, the crypto unit of Chicago-based Jump Trading, published on Thursday.
- The firm has largely remained silent about Terra's demise, including how Luna Foundation Guard allocates its remaining funds to compensate users of UST, or steps the firm took in a failed effort to restore the coin's 1-to-1 peg to the dollar.
- The findings, based on publicly available blockchain transactions, indicate that several large investors exited their position in Terra much earlier than many smaller ones, according to the report.
