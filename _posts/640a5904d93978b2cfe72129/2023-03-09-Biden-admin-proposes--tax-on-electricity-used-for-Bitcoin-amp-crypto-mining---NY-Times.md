The president spoke in Philadelphia after proposing a new spending plan that has no chance of passing a Republican House, but serves as an opening bid in what will be a fraught budget battle.

## Highlights

- President Biden proposes a $6.8 trillion budget that seeks to increase spending on the military and a wide range of new social programs.
- The budget contains some $5 trillion in proposed tax increases on high earners and corporations over a decade, much of which will offset new spending programs aimed at the middle class and the poor.
- It seeks to reduce budget deficits by nearly $3 trillion over that time, compared with the countryâ€™s current path.
- The plan was certain to draw swift criticism from Republicans, who are locked in an economically perilous debate with Mr.
- Biden over the borrowing limit, which House conservatives refuse to raise unless he agrees to sharp spending cuts.
