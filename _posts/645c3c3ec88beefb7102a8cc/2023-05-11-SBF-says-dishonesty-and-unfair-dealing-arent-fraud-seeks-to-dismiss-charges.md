FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried prepares to \"clear his name.\"

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has asked the court to dismiss 10 out of 13 charges against him against him.
- The charges stem from the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, which went bankrupt in 2022.
- Lawyers accuse the US of a "troubling" and "classic rush to judgment" in the wake of the collapse.
- They also say the US has failed to honor terms of an extradition treaty requiring that the Bahamas consent to all charges brought against him from his home in the Bahamas.
- Prosecutors say they have failed to substantiate most of their claims, and the case should be dismissed.
- The FTX CEO has pleaded not guilty and has asked for an oral argument to "clear his name"
