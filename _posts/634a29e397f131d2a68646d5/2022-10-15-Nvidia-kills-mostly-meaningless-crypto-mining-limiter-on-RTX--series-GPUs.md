Nvidia no longer blocks ethereum (ETH) mining on its graphics card, roughly one month after the second-most valuable cryptocurrency moved away from GPU mining altogether. Nvidia's Lite Hash

## Highlights

- Nvidia has reportedly removed the Lite Hash Rate (LHR) cryptocurrency limiter from its graphics card.
- LHR was released alongside the RTX 3060 as a way of dissuading cryptocurrency miners from buying up all the available stock of the graphics card at launch.
- Some miners even called LHR "pointless" following ethereum's shift from a proof-of-work algorithm, one which required GPU mining to validate the blockchain; to a proof of-stake algorithm, which uses consensus of validators instead, LHR has become even more pointless.
- The Merge, as the move is known as, took place on September 15, 2022, and reportedly no other cryptocurrencies are proving profitable enough.
