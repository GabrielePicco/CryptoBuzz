In the first day of the public beta, Coinbase's NFT marketplace attracted just 150 new users. Ouch.

## Highlights

- In the first day of the public beta, only 150 new users signed up with less than $75k traded on the platform.
- The marketplace has a total of 1192 users.
- The market leader, OpenSea, did $177 million in sales that day.
- Many argue that Coinbase has to perfect just one thing - make it dead simple to purchase NFT with my USD.
- And hire some NFT natives.
- Listen to what they have to say.
