STX is today's top performer, having surged by almost 20% to above $1.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin skyrocketed by roughly $2,000 in a day as the US Federal Reserve announced lending $300 billion to certain struggling US banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
- The asset went on a tear in the following days after struggling to remain above $20,000 last Friday amid growing banking issues.
- The bears finally came up to play and pushed the cryptocurrency south.
- The altcoins have also turned green today, with ETH reclaiming $1,700, while BNB, MATIC, DOGE, and DOT are up by over 5%.
- STX is today's top performer, having surged by almost 20% to above $1.1 trillion.
