Wormhole helps people move digital assets between Solana, Ethereum, and other blockchains. A hacker found a weak spot.

## Highlights

- Wormhole allows users to move tokens and NFTs between Solana and other blockchains.
- Network was "down for maintenance" due to a "potential exploit" of 120,000 Wrapped ETH tokens.
- Wormhole will give hacker $10 million for pointing out a vulnerability, but wants the tokens back.
- Earlier this week, Wormhole confirmed that it had suffered an exploit of over $320 million worth more than $250 million originally thought to have been caused by the exploit.
- The network was down for maintenance, but by that point the exploit appeared to be real, according to Wormhole's Twitter account.
- The company has not responded to a Decrypt request for comment.
