\"It is a great luck to catch a block with such a hashrate,\" someone claiming to be the miner wrote. “In less than a day, luck smiled on me.\"

## Highlights

- A solo Bitcoin miner was rewarded for adding block 780,112 to Bitcoin’s blockchain.
- The miner used the Solo CK Pool mining service to establish a solo mining pool, where they produced a valid hash for the block and received a reward of 6.25 BTC and a fee reward of 0.63 BTC.
- A miner of this size will solve a block on average about once every 10 months, Twitter user @ckpooldev stated.
- The block mined by the solo miner contained 3,220 transactions that consisted of around 16,940 worth of Bitcoin volume.
- An account on the Bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org stepped forward to claim responsibility for producing the valid hash.
