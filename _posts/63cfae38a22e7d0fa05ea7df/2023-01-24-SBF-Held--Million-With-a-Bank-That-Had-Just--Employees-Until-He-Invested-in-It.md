Farmington State Bank had just three employees and specialized in agricultural loans until FTX revealed an $11.5 million stake last year.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors seize $49,999,500 from Sam Bankman-Fried's Farmington State Bank account.
- The bank had just three employees and specialized in agricultural loans to farmers until March 2022.
- FTX founder's trading firm Alameda Research bought a $11.5 million stake in Farmington in March last year.
- The tiny rural bank said last week it'd be retiring the Moonstone name and returning to its roots as a community bank, with crypto hit by waves of high-profile bankruptcies and liquidity crises over the past year.
- Federal prosecutors are working to track down assets held by the disgraced founder.
- They have seized just over $100 million in an account with the crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital and $21 million with brokerage firm ED&F Man Capital Markets.
