## Highlights

- Netflix, Meta, PayPal, Shopify, and Zoom are among the most high-flying tech stocks in 2022.
- Bitcoin, Ether and other top tokens have tracked the performance of tech names for the last few quarters now it looks like the latter are sliding even further in this punishing period.
- Netflix fell an astonishing 35% on Wednesday, shedding more than $54B in market value.
- Bitcoin’s worst one-day drop was about 40% on March 12, 2020, but that was triggered by the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and was part of a broader sell-off across the markets.
- Chinese stocks have also taken a beating, with the CSI 300 and Hang Seng indexes sliding.
