Elon Musk is seen as a supervillain for using $44 billion of his own money to buy Twitter, but Sam Bankman-Fried is treated with kid gloves for losing billions belonging to others.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried has been on a media tour since losing tens of billions of dollars in his over-leveraged and shadily funded businesses, FTX and Alameda.
- He is still scheduled for a Twitter Space and a YouTube interview to round out his week.
- The media figures covering him seems relatively calm, not being treated like a "crypto supervillain" The media doesn't have a very different reaction to another billionaire, Elon Musk, who used $44 billion of his own money in 2022 to purchase Twitter.
- One reason we donâ€™t hear about how much of his wealth should have been invested in causes worthy of the media, which could certainly be used for hunger.
