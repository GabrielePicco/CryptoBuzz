The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is continuing to fight an order in its lawsuit against Ripple that requires the SEC to divulge internal email conversations from 2018.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing to fight an order in its lawsuit against Ripple that requires the SEC to divulge internal email conversations from 2018.
- The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging that the company sold XRP as an unregistered security.
- The regulator also filed individual charges against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s co-founder, Chris Larsen.
- In a new motion, the SEC is arguing that the judge's dismissal of Garlinghhouse and Larsen's motion gives them extra leeway not to disclose the Hinman emails.
- The regulatory agency in a new supplemental letter says Judge Torres’ ruling makes it clear their internal documents are irrelevant.
