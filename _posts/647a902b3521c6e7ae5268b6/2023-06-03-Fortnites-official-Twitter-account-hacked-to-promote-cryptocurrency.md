In a strange turn of events, Fortnite's official Twitter account was hacked a few hours ago.

## Highlights

- In a strange turn of events, Fortnite's official Twitter account was hacked a few hours ago.
- While it's still unclear who was responsible for the hack, once carried out, a post promoting $FNITE TOKEN was posted on FNCompetitive's timeline.
- Since Epic Games has stated time and again that cryptocurrency is not part of the game's ecosystem, seeing this on an official account raised a few eyebrows.
- It's unclear if refunds will be given, but looking at past lessons, the answer is definitely no.
- In exchange, the community wants the Shotgun Striker "Siphon" Reality Augment to be added back to the game.
