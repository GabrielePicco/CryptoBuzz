Bored Ape's Bored and Hungry restaurant in Los Angeles has gone back to accepting good old fashioned US dollars as its sole currency for ape-themed food.

## Highlights

- Bored Ape's Bored and Hungry restaurant in Los Angeles has gone back to accepting US dollars as its sole currency for ape-themed food.
- The fast food shop opened in April and accepted digital currency as well as dollars.
- But that was before record-breaking market crashes that depleted millions in investor dollars and tanked entire crypto coins.
- Since the giant market meltdown, crypto companies have been laying off employees, and Congress even made the first moves toward regulating the industry for the first time in history.
- The LA Times said owner Andy Nguyen didn't respond to emails about the change, either, although a cashier gave some noncommittal answers when asked in person.
