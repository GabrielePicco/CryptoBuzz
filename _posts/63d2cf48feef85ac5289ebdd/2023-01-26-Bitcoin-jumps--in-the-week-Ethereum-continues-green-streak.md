Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have consolidated over the week as the broader crypto market continues to enjoy a bullish spell.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to hit a January high of $23,501 on Wednesday before dropping to $22,974.
- Bitcoin has gained an impressive 36% in the last 30 days, with the worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency at a height not seen since August.
- January has been a break-out month for Bitcoin and Ethereum amid a biting crypto winter that has seen layoffs and bankruptcy filings.
- The overall market capitalization appears to be holding steady above $1 trillion, after reclaiming that figure on January 14.
- Still, this is a far cry from the industry's peak back in November 2021 when crypto coins commanded over $3 trillion in value.
