Data shows Binance’s BUSD stablecoin losing its share of market dominance due to regulatory threats and investors’ concerns about the exchange’s fund management.

## Highlights

- Stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market help provide U.S.
- dollar-pegged tokens within the volatile industry.
- Binance USD (BUSD) has seen a major usage decline in recent weeks.
- BUSD's market cap has continued to fall due to problems with the token’s management that first came to light in January 2023.
- The lack of stablecoin use outside of its parent exchange, Binance, does not bode well for its market cap if the trend sustains over a long period of time.
- A recent move by SWIFT to lower dollar transfers on Binance suggests that the stablecoin could continue to face major headwinds.
