title:  "Coinbase CEO: Crypto firms will develop \"offshore\" without clear regulations"
description: "LONDON (Reuters) -The U.S. and Britain should make their rules for the crypto industry much clearer to prevent firms from developing in \"offshore havens\", the chief of U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc, Brian Armstrong, said on Tuesday.  The failure last year of the Bahamas-based FTX exchange has highlighted the importance of major economies developing clear crypto regulations, Armstrong said at a conference held by the Innovate Finance industry body.  \"This is the reason why we need clarity about legislation and regulation onshore because if the UK doesn't have this, if the U.S. doesn't have this, these firms are going to be built in offshore havens,\" Armstrong said."
