Congressman Madison Cawthorn could face charges for violating insider trading laws after promoting a cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme.

## Highlights

- Madison Cawthorn, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, has been accused of his involvement in a pump and dump crypto scheme dubbed Lets Go Brandon (LETSGO) Several regulatory watchdogs have implicated him in an alleged insider trading scheme involving the relatively short-lived crypto project.
- Hedge fund manager James Koutoulas pioneered the project.
- NASCAR driver Brandon Brown revealed that the crypto project will be the primary sponsor of his 2022 season.
- NASCAR rejected the projectâ€™s sponsorship deal with Brown in January 2022.
- Unidentified insiders who had purchased a substantial amount of the coins in circulation quickly dumped all of them.
- This caused the memecoin to plummet to zero, and investors were left scratching their heads in losses.
