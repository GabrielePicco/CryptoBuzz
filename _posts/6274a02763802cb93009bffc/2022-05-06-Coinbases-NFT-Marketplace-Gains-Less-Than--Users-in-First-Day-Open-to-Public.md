The Coinbase NFT marketplace opened its beta to the public yesterday, but the platform hasn't seen much activity.

## Highlights

- Coinbase NFT, the cryptocurrency exchangeâ€™s newly launched NFT marketplace, is so far failing to attract users.
- The market for NFTs ballooned to more than $20 billion in 2021 and is on pace to far exceed that figure by the end of 2022.
- On its first day, the marketplace, which opened its beta up to the public yesterday, saw less than 150 new users sign up for its platform.
- The total number of users on the marketplace has 1,112 as of Wednesday evening, according to data from Dune Analytics.
- The timing of the launch is also likely an issue for the market, with the market firmly in a bear market.
