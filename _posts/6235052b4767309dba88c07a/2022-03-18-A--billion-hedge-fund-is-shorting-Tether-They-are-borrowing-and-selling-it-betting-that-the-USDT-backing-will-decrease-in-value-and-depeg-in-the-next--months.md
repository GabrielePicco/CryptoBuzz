Hedger fund Fir Tree Capital is betting that stablecoin Tether will have issues with the relatively assets that back the stablecoin

## Highlights

- Hedge fund Fir Tree Capital Management is shorting stablecoin Tether, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization.
- The $4 billion hedge fund sees Tetherâ€™s $24 billion in commercial paper as main vulnerability.
- Tether was fined $41 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for misleading statements about the reserves of the stablecoin.
- Fir Tree expects some of the paper to decline in value, causing a fall in its reserves.
- The hedge fund believes its short position will pay off within 12 months.
- There are concerns that Tether could negatively impact the entire crypto sector if Tether collapsed, according to Bloomberg's Businessweek.
