Senators Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have introduced a new bill aiming to make small crypto transactions tax-free.

## Highlights

- Senators Patrick Toomey and Kyrsten Sinema have introduced a new bill to the U.S.
- Senate to exclude small crypto transactions from capital gains tax requirements.
- The bill would apply to transactions worth less than $50, with a provision to adjust that benchmark alongside inflation.
- Similar bills, putting the benchmark at $200, have been introduced to Congress in the past.
- Similar initiatives have previously been introduced in two other bills still sitting in Congress, but thereâ€™s been little indication that they will be voted into law anytime soon.
- In June, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced a comprehensive crypto bill that, among other things, also sought to cut taxes on all crypto transactions smaller than $200.
