- Palmer has called Musk a "grifter" and accused the Tesla CEO of being unable to run basic code, citing an instance several years ago when the billionaire allegedly didn't know how to run a Python script that Palmer sent him.
- The engineer has traded jabs with the billionaire in the past, accusing him of being a 'grifter' and not being an objective.
