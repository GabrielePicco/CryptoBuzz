Three Arizona senators have proposed that Arizona residents vote on whether to amend the state’s constitution to make crypto exempt from property taxes.

## Highlights

- Three Arizona senators have proposed that Arizona residents vote on whether to amend the state’s constitution to make virtual currency exempt from property taxes.
- The bill, SCR 1007, was introduced in the first session of the Arizona State Senate in 2023.
- Lawmakers in previous sessions have attempted to move forward on legislation related to crypto and taxes, such as a 2018 bill allowing residents to submit tax payments in crypto.
- However, the proposed legislation would face a different political climate than that of 2018 or even 2022, with some lawmakers questioning the fair and legitimate election of some state and federal lawmakers.
- At the federal level, sales or purchases of cryptocurrency are generally subject to capital gains taxes in the United States.
