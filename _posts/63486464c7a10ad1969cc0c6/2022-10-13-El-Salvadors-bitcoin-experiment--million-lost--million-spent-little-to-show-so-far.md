The use of bitcoin in El Salvador appears to be low, as the currency has lost about 60% of its value since the experiment started.

## Highlights

- El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender in June.
- The use of bitcoin in El Salvador appears to be low, as the currency has lost about 60% of its value since the experiment started.
- The country still faces plummeting economic growth and a high deficit.
- El Salvador's debt-to-GDP ratio is set to hit nearly 87% this year, stoking fears that the nation isn't equipped to settle its loan obligations.
- A survey by the El Salvador-based public opinion think tank found that bitcoin is popular in El Zonte, but it's clear that not massive adoption is not massive, says Jaime Garcia.
