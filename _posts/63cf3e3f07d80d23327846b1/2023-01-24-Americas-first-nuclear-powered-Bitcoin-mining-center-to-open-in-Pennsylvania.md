The construction of the first nuclear-powered data center in the U.S. expected to host Bitcoin mining has been completed.

## Highlights

- 48-megawatt, 300,000-square-foot data center is directly connected to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in northeast Pennsylvania.
- The facility is expected to host Bitcoin mining and cloud computing services – the first of its kind in the U.S.
- The development of the zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility called the Nautilus Cryptomine at the campus was first announced in August 2021.
- The Virunga National Park in eastern Congo is mining Bitcoin using hydro-electricity to provide the necessary funding to protect the forests and wildlife in Africa’s oldest protected park, affected by years of militia violence, deforestation and poor government assistance.
