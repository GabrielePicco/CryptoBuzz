- The collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem resulted in losses to investors of tens of billions of dollars, according to new research uncovered by blockchain security company Uppsala Security and CoinDesk Korea.
- The report was published on June 14, and was published by CoinDesk Korean prosecutors.
- It is now being investigated by the South Korean authorities.
