Just like Putin, Zuckerberg went all-in on something that he wasn’t really ready to handle, putting everything else in jeopardy as a result.

## Highlights

- Mark Zuckerberg is trying to find a way out of trouble his 'visionary' fantasies are pushing his business into trouble.
- Zuckerberg has failed to predict the rise of image-centric social media (Instagram and video) and direct messaging superseding traditional SMS messages, and even phone calls (WhatsApp) He has decided to leap forward and try to predict what the next social media medium may appear to disrupt the market and/or redefine human interaction online in the future.
- The only answer, in his mind, could be virtual reality (VR), writes Eva Strauss.
- Strauss: Zuckerberg is being led astray by his ego, but can neither hear the warnings from their ivory towers.
