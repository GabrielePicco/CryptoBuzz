## Highlights

- Inflation reached 85.5% over a sliding year in October 2022, official figures show.

- The Turkish lira has lost 28% of its value against the US dollar since the beginning of 2022 and had already fallen 44% against the greenback by 2021.
- It is high time that Erdogan comes back to earth and stops playing the sorcerer's apprentice in matters of economy, while the Turkish people are suffering more than ever.
