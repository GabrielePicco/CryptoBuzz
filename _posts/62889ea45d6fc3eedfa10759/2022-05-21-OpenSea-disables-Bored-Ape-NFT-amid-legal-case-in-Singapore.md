The Bored Ape NFT, worth at least $190,000, was blocked on OpenSea after a court injunction in Singapore over a loan deal gone bad.

## Highlights

- Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token BAYC #2162 is now marked with a “reported for suspicious activity” tag on OpenSea, the world's largest NFT marketplace.
- This tag prevents the current owner from being able to list the NFT for sale.
- An individual called Rajesh Rajkumar was able to secure an injunction from the Singapore High Court blocking the sale.
- The BoredApe NFT, worth at least $190,000, was blocked after a loan agreement with pseudonymous NFT collector chefpierre.eth soured, according to a court filing and a statement from Singaporean law firm.
