## Highlights

- Samuel Bankman-Fried became the most talked-about and arguably hated person in the cryptocurrency industry in November when his empire collapsed.
- SBF claimed that he and his executives made an accounting error, which led to the loss of $8 billion.
- Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Bitcoin's largest exchange, doesn't believe SBF's story.
- Bill Ackman, Kevin O'Leary and Kevin Oâ€™Leary have also stood with the former FTX chief.
- Some prominent figures in the community are backing SBF, even though he admitted to losing'millions' as an investor in FTX, and he famously said that the exchange is as safe as it gets earlier.
