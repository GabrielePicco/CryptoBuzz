The Minnesota representative said Gensler’s agency has failed to gather critical information from crypto companies.

## Highlights

- Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer called out Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler on Sunday.
- Emmer said the SEC had failed to gather critical information from crypto companies that would have prevented disasters like the collapse of the $32 billion dollar collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
- The Minnesota representative also called out the SEC's lack of transparency in its regulatory approach to regulating crypto companies.
- He also claimed that the Congressional Blockchain Caucus has received reports of SEC inquiries and investigations that warrant concern.
- In March, Emmer raised concerns about the SEC’s interactions with crypto companies, but said at the time that the agency was stifling innovation with an “overburdensome” approach.
