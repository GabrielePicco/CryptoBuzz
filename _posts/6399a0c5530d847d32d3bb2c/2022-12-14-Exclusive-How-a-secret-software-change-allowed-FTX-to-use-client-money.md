## Highlights

- SEC charges FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with fraud.
- FTX chief engineer tweaked code to exempt Alameda Research from a feature that would have automatically sold off Alameda's assets if it was losing too much borrowed money.
- The exemption allowed Alameda to keep borrowing funds from FTX irrespective of the value of the collateral securing those loans.
- Alameda was allowed to maintain a negative balance on its account, the SEC said.
- The SEC said the tweak meant Alameda had a “virtually unlimited line of credit’s credit” FTX declared bankruptcy on Nov.
- 11 after a liquidity crunch forced the cryptocurrency exchange to declare bankruptcy.
