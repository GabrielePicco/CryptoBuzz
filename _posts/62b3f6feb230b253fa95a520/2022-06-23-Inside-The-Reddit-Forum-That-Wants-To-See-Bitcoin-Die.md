Cryptocurrency haters have found a home—and common cause—trashing the volatile asset class and wishing for its demise.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin in particular earns his ire.
- Bitcoin's history is a series of get-rich-quick schemes, says a 54-year-old IT administrator in London.
- Buttcoin, the name a suggestion that cryptocurrencies are, well, a waste of time, is a Reddit forum called Buttcoin.
- Despite two decades of steadily increasing mainstream acceptance, crypto remains an undeniable easy target—a remarkable leap of the New York Yankees.
- There’s nothing backing of crypto, the super volatile, super-volatile asset class has no real value tied to a physical object, its value has to ping-pongly on a consistent basis.
- But Buttcoiners aren’t any more buttoned-up online than their idealist counterparts.
