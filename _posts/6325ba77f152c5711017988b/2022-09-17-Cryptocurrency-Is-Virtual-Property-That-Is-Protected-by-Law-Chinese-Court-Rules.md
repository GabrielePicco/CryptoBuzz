The court clarified that regulations issued by the Bank of China and others only prohibit the circulation of virtual currency.

## Highlights

- A Chinese intermediate court in Beijing recently upheld a lower court’s ruling that designated litecoin a virtual property protected by the law.
- The court clarified that regulations issued by the Bank of China and others only prohibit the circulation of virtual currency.
- Litecoin is a ‘network currency’ but still lacks key properties of a currency such as “legal compensation and compulsion” The court ruled that the decision of the lower court would stand, and that Hao must return the outstanding 33,000 LTC to Zhai Wenjie.
- Hao argued that the regulations cited by the defendant are merely “regulatory opinions” and that these in no way diminish his obligations.
