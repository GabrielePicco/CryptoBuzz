Dan Olson’s YouTube documentary “Line Goes Up” is like “The Big Short,” except crypto is the housing crisis.

## Highlights

- His 13-part "The Problem with NFTs" was recently trending on Twitter.
- Olson is in a transitional stage in his career, gravitating toward a more conventional documentary style.
- Olson: "My channel is edutainment, absolutely.
