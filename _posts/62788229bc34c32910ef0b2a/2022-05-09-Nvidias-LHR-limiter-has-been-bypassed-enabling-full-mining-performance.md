Over a year ago, Nvidia launched Lite Hash Rate (LHR) versions of most of its RTX 3000 lineup, which it designed to significantly reduce the mining performance...

## Highlights

- NiceHash's mining software can now bypass the mining limiter Nvidia put on LHR versions of its Ampere lineup, restoring the full mining performance to most GPUs.
- An unlocked RTX 3080 Ti can now readily get over 110 MH/s, whereas before, it was limited to about 80 MH/S.
- However, this might not be as bad as it sounds, as Ethereum's transition to a Proof-of-Stake algorithm is expected to happen this year.
- With most cards, you'd need close to a year to break even, while Ethereum's price is currently half of its peak, so this news will probably not affect the market too much.
