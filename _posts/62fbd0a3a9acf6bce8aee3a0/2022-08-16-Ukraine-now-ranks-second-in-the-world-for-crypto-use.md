Crypto has taken off around the world, going from hype to reality - but digital currency hasn’t been embraced with the same enthusiasm everywhere.

## Highlights

- The US, Ukraine, and the UK are the top 3 countries for crypto use worldwide, based on the number of crypto owners, businesses that accept cryptos and the amount of Bitcoin ATMs available.
- Bogota, Colombia boasts the most businesses accepting payments in crypto.
- Vietnam is the only country with no businesses currently accepting crypto payments in Vietnam.
- Ukraine is the second country after the US in terms of crypto use.
- The country had started embracing cryptocurrency before the beginning of the war and was already ranked fourth for cryptocurrency adoption among its citizens in 2021.
- But as soon as the war against Russia broke out, the Ukrainian government took the strategic decision to expand its use of crypto to support its economy.
