The Shanghai High People's Court ruled that Bitcoin has a ‘certain economic value' and is a virtual asset protected by the country's laws.

## Highlights

- Shanghai High People's Court ruled Bitcoin has a 'certain economic value' and is a virtual asset protected by the country’s laws.
- The ruling is monumental considering that China has banned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, citing a threat to the country's financial sector stability.
- It is unclear if other higher courts can adopt a similar stand on Bitcoin.
- China has a longstanding opposition against cryptocurrencies, with last year's directive to outlaw cryptocurrency trading and mining being considered significant after the impact on the general market.
- The directive by the court would act as a significant point of reference for Bitcoin-related civil disputes within the Shanghai area, a Beijing lawyer Liu Yang said.
