\"Talking about survival of digital assets is firmly over — the question is now about evolution,\" says Julian Sawyer, CEO of Bitstamp.

## Highlights

- Bitstamp surveyed more than 28,000 investors from 23 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.
- A further 80 per cent of institutional investors reported that cryptos will overtake traditional investment vehicles.
- Levels of trust in the digital currency as an asset class is high, with 71 per cent saying they trust crypto.
- But trust on a global level is mostly driven by developing countries, the survey showed.
- Almost half of the retail investors surveyed said they see crypto as unregulated.
- European Parliament voted in favour of new traceability rules for crypto asset providers requiring them to collect information on the holders they interact with.
