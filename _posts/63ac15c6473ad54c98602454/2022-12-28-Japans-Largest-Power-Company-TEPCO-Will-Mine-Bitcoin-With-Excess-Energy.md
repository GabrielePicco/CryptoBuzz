In an effort to make use of its excess energy, TEPCO Power Grid is establishing Bitcoin mining facilities across Japan in collaboration with a local semiconductor company.

## Highlights

- TEPCO Power Grid is collaborating with a local semiconductor designer and developer, TRIPLE-1, in order to mine Bitcoin using excess energy around the country.
- The Fukushima nuclear plant was damaged in 2011 by an enormous tsunami and earthquake that destroyed portions of its cooling systems and caused three reactors to melt down.
- The power company later acknowledged that it should have taken more aggressive action to avert such calamities.
- Through the partnership, Agile hopes to set up dispersed data centers all over Japan that utilize semiconductors and surplus electricity from renewable sources.
- The company also stated that “we believe that selecting and introducing energy-saving products that have a low environmental impact is an important initiative”
