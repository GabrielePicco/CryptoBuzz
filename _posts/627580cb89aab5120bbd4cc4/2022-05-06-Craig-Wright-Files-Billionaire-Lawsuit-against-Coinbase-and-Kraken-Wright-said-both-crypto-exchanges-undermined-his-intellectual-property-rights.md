Craig Wright, an Australian cryptographer who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin creator, has sued Coinbase and Kraken for alleged copyright infringement.

## Highlights

- “Satoshi Nakamoto” is the alias of the mysterious person (or group of people) responsible for the creation and launch of Bitcoin back in 2009.
- Nakamoto was the first to effectively solve the double-spending problem for digital currency using a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network.
- While Nakamoto claimed on his P2P Foundation profile in 2012 that he was a 37-year-old man from Japan, others speculated that he is from an English-speaking country due to his use of perfect English.
- Ultimately, the real-world identity of Satoshi has never been established and remains a mystery to this day.
