In April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African government and second in the world to recognize bitcoin as legal cash.

## Highlights

- Central African Republic has announced plans to use bitcoin as reserve currency.
- In April, the CAR became the first African government and second in the world to recognize bitcoin as legal cash.
- The CAR national assembly passed the bill after Minister of Digital Economy Gourna Zacko and Minister of Finance Calixte Nganongo developed the proposal.
- The bill would mean that the CAR would hold the leading crypto along with other currencies and assets in a pool of resources for use in transfers and balancing international transactions and payments.
- It would be a follow-up to the CAR's decision to legalize bitcoin in April to recognize the world's largest cryptocurrency as a legal currency.
