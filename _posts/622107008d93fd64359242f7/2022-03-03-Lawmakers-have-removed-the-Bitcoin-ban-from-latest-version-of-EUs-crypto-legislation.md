## Highlights

- EU's "Markets in Crypto-Assets" or MiCA directive has been stripped of a passage that many feared would lead to a ban on cryptocurrencies that use proof-of-work.
- The section that seemed poised to bar proof of work tokens from the EU is gone from the latest version of the bill, which is set for votes in coming weeks.
- The draft bill is not expected to change dramatically.
- If it passes those votes, the bill will face trilogue debates including the European Commission and Council, as well as Parliament, to be voted on by Parliament in March or April.
