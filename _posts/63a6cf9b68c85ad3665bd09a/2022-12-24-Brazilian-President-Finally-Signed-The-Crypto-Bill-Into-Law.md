The President of Brazil just signed the crypto regulation. This will ensure a regulated framework within which cryptocurrencies will operate.

## Highlights

- The President of Brazil has just signed the crypto regulation bill into law.
- This will ensure a regulated framework within which cryptocurrencies will operate.
- With the newly passed law, digital currencies will now be classified as a legal payment method in Brazil.
- This makes Brazil one of the first South American countries to have officially recognized Bitcoin as a medium of payment and even an investment asset.
- The law is expected to go into effect 180 days from the day it was passed; however, it is to be remembered that Bitcoin is not considered a legal tender in Brazil as of now.
- The Central Bank of Brazil will supposedly supervise Bitcoinâ€™s payment usage, and the Securities and Exchange Commission will be looking into investments related to cryptocurrencies.
