- The countryâ€™s Minister of Tourism revealed the information, saying that there was an increase in the Q4 2021, 300 million or so more than expected.
- President Nayib Bukele has said that bitcoin usage has exceeded expectations.
- The International Monetary Fund has urged El Salvador to drop bitcoin as a currency, citing financial stability risks.
