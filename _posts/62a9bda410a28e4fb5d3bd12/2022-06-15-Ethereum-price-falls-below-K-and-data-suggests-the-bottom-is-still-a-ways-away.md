ETH price has stalled around the $1,100 level, but several data points suggest the altcoin’s sell-off is far from complete.

## Highlights

- Ether (ETH) price nosedived below $1,100 in the early hours of June 14 to prices not seen since January 2021.
- The downside move marks a 78% correction since the $4,870 all-time high on Nov.
- 10, 2021.
- Ether has underperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 33% between May 10 and June 14, 2022, and the last time a similar event happened was mid-2021.
- The 31% Ether underperformance versus Bitcoin back in June 2021 reflected a cool-off period after unprecedented growth in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- But this time, there is no DeFi Summer and before this year’s negative performance versus Bitcoin, the active address indicator was already slightly bearish.
