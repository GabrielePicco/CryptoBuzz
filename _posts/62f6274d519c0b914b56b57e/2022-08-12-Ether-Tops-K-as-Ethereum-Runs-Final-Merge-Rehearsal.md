Merge optimism has prompted an ether rally of 60% in four weeks.

## Highlights

- Some have been buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and selling futures contracts.
- This creates a situation where futures trade at a discount to the spot price.
- The strategy would help traders pocket free coins from a potential post-merge chain split without having to worry about losses from ether price volatility.
- Merge optimism has prompted an ether rally of 60% in four weeks in just four weeks.
