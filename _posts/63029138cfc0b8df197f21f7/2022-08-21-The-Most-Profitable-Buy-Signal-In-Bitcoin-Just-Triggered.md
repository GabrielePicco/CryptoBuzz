The latest trend in the Bitcoin \"hash ribbon\" indicator has just formed a pattern that has historically been a buy signal for the crypto. Bitcoin Hash

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's hashrate has just passed above the 60-day SMA version of the 30-day MA hashrate.
- This is a measure of the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin blockchain by the miners.
- During bear markets, some miners’ income drops so low that running their operations becomes unprofitable for them.
- The latest trend in the Bitcoin "hash ribbon" indicator has just formed a pattern that has historically been a buy signal for the crypto.
- At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $21.3k, down 13% in the past week.
- It has also now been more than 2 years since the last halving event, which, going by the past trend, would suggest this is one of those rare “most profitable” buy signals
