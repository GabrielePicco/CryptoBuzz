A alleged transaction misstep could wipe out the debt Genesis owes to Gemini if a bankruptcy judge ends up siding with the now-bankrupt crypto lender.

## Highlights

- A alleged transaction misstep could wipe out the debt Genesis owes to Gemini if a bankruptcy judge ends up siding with the now-bankrupt crypto lending unit of Digital Currency Group.
- A footnote disputes that claim, pointing to a sale by Gemini of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares that Genesis put up as collateral in behind-the-scenes agreements struck between the lender and Gemini last year.
- "The question is whether or not Gemini’s claim is valid," says bankruptcy attorney Mark Pfeiffer, who is not involved in the case.
- "Even if the court sides with Gemini, that they did everything right and has a claim, that doesn’t mean the Gemini creditors get paid, because this is bankruptcy," he says.
