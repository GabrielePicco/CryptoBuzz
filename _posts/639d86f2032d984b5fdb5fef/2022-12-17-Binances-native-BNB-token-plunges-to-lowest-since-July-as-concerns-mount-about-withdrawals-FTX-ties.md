Crypto exchange giant Binance, the firm that would potentially bail out FTX, is facing its own questions now, and investors are selling out of its native coin.

## Highlights

- Binance's native token, BNB, has fallen 15% in the past week, including a drop of over 6% in 24 hours.
- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao dismissed concerns that his company could have money clawed back from FTX.
- FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested this week in the Bahamas and charged by U.S.
- prosecutors with fraud and money laundering.
- In June, the SEC was investigating whether the 2017 token sale amounted to a security offered that should have been registered with regulators.
- A day later, Binance backed out of the deal, stating that FTX's "issues are beyond our control or ability to help"
