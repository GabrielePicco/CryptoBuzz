## Highlights

- The price of Ether (ETH) shot up as much as 13.5% in the last 24 hours, recovering from the sharp market decline brought on after news of higher-than-expected inflation data released on Wednesday.
- The second-largest cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $1,223.
- That’s still down 75% from its November all-time high, but large scale investors known as whales are taking advantage of the latest market downturn by buying the dip.
- Big fish, or the people who the crypto world call “whales”—are accumulating Ether, the cryptocurrency native to Ethereum, ahead of the network's highly anticipated “merge” upgrade.
