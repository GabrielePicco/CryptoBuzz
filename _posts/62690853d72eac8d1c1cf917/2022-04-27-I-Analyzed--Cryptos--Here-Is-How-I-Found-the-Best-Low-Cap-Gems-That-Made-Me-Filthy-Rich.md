I describe my sure-fire way for anyone reading this to make money in the crypto currency investing space just by following these 5 simple rules today...

## Highlights

- For every low-cap hidden gem, there are 100 stupid face plant coins.
- For every coin you invest in is too good to be true, it probably is.
- Here are the rules that I personally use when investing in crypto.
- These are the same rules I’ve used to make me so mad filthy rich that I get to hang out with people like Elon Musk and the evil Winklevoss twins.
- The rules are: Never invest while drunk.
- Dog coins get a pass.
