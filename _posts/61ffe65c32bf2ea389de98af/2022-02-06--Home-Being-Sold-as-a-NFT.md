A Gulfport house will sell at auction next week to transfer the property rights “instantaneously” over the blockchain in a first for the region and maybe the nation.

## Highlights

- A home in Gulfport, Florida, will be auctioned as a “non-fungible token” for $650,000.
- The property rights will be minted into a digital token and auctioned online.
- The NFT is stored on a decentralized ledger known as the blockchain and is typically used for digital assets like music and art.
- It's not clear if the value of a house tied to an NFT would be affected by the crypto market.
- A local real estate expert said using NFTs in real estate transactions would bridge the physical and digital worlds, like Venmo transactions.
- It’s hard to say how this could work in the future.
