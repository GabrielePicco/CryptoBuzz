Strike's brash CEO believes the Bitcoin network's capacity for real time money transfer will disrupt the credit card industry.

## Highlights

- Chicago-based company announces $80 million funding round.
- CEO Jack Mallers says Strike will use the money to develop partnerships with major retailers such as Wendy’s and Starbucks.
- Mallers predicts as many as 50% of U.S.
- businesses could come to adopt the technology by the end of 2023.
- He's known as a “Bitcoin maxi”—crypto slang for those who favor only the original cryptocurrency and are contemptuous of newer blockchains like Etherum and Solana.
- Despite his abrasive persona, Mallers speaks thoughtfully and persuasively about why Bitcoin is ripe to disrupt traditional payment networks.
