Ethereum skyrocketed to a monthly high in a massive hourly candle, leaving over $150 million liquidated.

## Highlights

- The price of ETH has exploded in the past couple of hours, reaching an intraday high at around $1420.
- This happens a day after developers confirmed that the ETH 2.0 merge is on track to happen in September.
- The last time ETH was trading at these prices was back on June 13th, meaning that the cryptocurrency charted a monthly high.
- The volume on that candle has been over $300 million, leaving over $150 million in liquidation.
- The largest single liquidation order happened on FTX, and it carried a face value of $2.81 million.
