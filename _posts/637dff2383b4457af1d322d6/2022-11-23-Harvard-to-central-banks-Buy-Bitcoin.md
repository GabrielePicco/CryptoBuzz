## Highlights

- Harvard paper to central banks: Buy Bitcoin!
- According to Matthew Ferranti, it's a good thing that crypto could provide a workaround to U.S.
- sanctions.
- He argues that it makes sense for many central banks to hold a small amount of Bitcoin under normal circumstances, and much more Bitcoin if they face sanctions risks.
- He says gold is a more useful sanctions hedge because it's five times less volatile than Bitcoin.
- The paper doesn't say anything about whether applying sanctions is a good or bad thing, but it might make countries pause and think about, “How reliable is the U.-S?” FD caught up with Ferrantsi at Harvard’s Cabot Science Library to discuss the paper.
