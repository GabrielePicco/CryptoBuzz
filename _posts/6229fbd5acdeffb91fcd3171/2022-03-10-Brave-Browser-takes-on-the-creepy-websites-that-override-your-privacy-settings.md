Even if you block 3rd-party cookies, bounce tracking can set them anyway. Until now.

## Highlights

- Brave browser will roll out unlinkable bouncing in version 1.37 slated for March 29.
- The feature is designed to prevent what's known as bounce tracking.
- It's one of the key ways websites circumvent third-party cookie blocking.
- Brave has several other ways to prevent site tracking, including debouncing, debouncing and de-blacking.
- The new feature is the first of four planned applications to allow a user to re-identify a site to identify a user once they've been bounced through it.
- Brave's privacy team outlined the process in a post on Wednesday.
