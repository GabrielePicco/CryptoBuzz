The passphrase is an advanced security feature. It adds an extra word of your own choosing to your recovery phrase to unlock a brand-new set of accounts.

## Highlights

- Ledgerâ€™s Passphrase is an advanced security feature that allows you to add an additional word to your 24-word recovery phrase.
- Unlike the regular recovery phrase, you would choose the 25th word of your own choosing.
- The passphrase is sensitive to caps and can be composed of numbers and signs as well.
- The Passphrase grants you plausible deniability when under duress.
- Ledger devices have the highest certificate when it comes to the quality of our True Random Number Generator (TRNG) used to create your recovery phrase and create your own word for the first time.
- We would like to add that only using a recovery phrase created by a Ledger device is highly secure as well.
