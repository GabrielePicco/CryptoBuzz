The Swiss luxury watchmaker did not cancel the possibility of offering cryptocurrency payments in stores in the future.

## Highlights

- Swiss luxury brand Tag Heuer will accept twelve major cryptocurrencies plus five stablecoins as payment options on its US website.
- CEO Frédéric Arnault said the company had paid attention to Bitcoin since its birth and that the recent ups and downs of the crypto market did not change its view of digital currencies as a transformative technology.
- Gucci announced earlier this month that it will accept digital currencies in a selection of US stores this month.
- The Italian high-end luxury fashion house Gucci also announced earlier that it would accept digital currency payments in its US stores.
- The company noted that this option might arrive in the future, but it isn’t a priority for now.
