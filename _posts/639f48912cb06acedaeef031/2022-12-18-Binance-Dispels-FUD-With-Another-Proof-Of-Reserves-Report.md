Binance dispels the 'liquidity rumors', as it released a new report on its proof-of-reserves (PoR) by analytics provider CryptoQuant.

## Highlights

- Binanceâ€™s BTC liabilities or customer deposits are 97% collateralized by Binance's assets.
- This collateralization grows 101% when the BTC loaned out to customers is included.
- Binance does not show any FTX-like behavior as the native token (BNB) is not a large share of the reserves.
- Author of last week's reserves report of Binance, Mazars, will reportedly no longer take crypto client.
- The decision to say no to crypto came after the release of a controversial report about Binance last week.
- Following the backlash, Mazar pulled down the report from its website, following the backlash.
