- On Friday, employees received worse news: They were told via email the company was basically shutting down.
- CEO Ioannis Giannaros told Axios via email that the company is “still operating but will be scaling back to plan our next steps’ The current fundraising atmosphere, fueled by the FTX implosion and falling cryptocurrency prices, likely made it impossible for Wyre to raise new capital.
