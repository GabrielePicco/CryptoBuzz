I fear global bank regulators are about to make a decision that will unintentionally \"obsolete\" the banks, by prohibiting a coming tech pivot.

## Highlights

- David Rothkopf: Fintechs provide efficient front-ends that act as “middleware” between antiquated back-end systems and the user experience demanded by customers.
- He says most of the telecom industry’s copper-wire networks became obsolete after “Money Over Internet Protocols” came along, banks still had a role because fintchs still needed to partner with a. legacy bank to settle their customers’ US dollar payments.
- Despite all the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax problems faced by their products, and all the criminals and fraudsters running rampant (who should be in jail), the tech industry has proven its ability to go around the banks.
