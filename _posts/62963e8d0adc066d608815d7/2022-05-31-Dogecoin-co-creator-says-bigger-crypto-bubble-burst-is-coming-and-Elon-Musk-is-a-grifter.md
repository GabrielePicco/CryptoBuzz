The creator of a memecoin-turned-top cryptocurrency says his interactions with Elon Musk didn't impress him, and predicted that crypto is still headed for a big crash.

## Highlights

- Jackson Palmer is the co-founder of Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency.
- He says Elon Musk is a 'grifter' who pretends to understand coding.
- Palmer thinks Musk's takeover bid is a ploy to either destroy the platform or drive its value down further.
- He expects there will be a bigger, longer, longer bubble burst at some point in the future.
- Palmer says more people are paying attention to the flaws of cryptocurrency and the community surrounding it.
- He sees more support for his scepticism from people still involved in the community, but not necessarily leading them to leave the cryptocurrency scene.
