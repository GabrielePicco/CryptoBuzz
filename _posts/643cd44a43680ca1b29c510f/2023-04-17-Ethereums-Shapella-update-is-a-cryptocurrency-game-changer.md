## Highlights

- On Wednesday, Ethereum carried out a critical upgrade to The Merge, known as Shapella, which will further drive the use of the cryptocurrency as a decentralized ecosystem.
- If The Merge enabled the move from proof-of-work to proof of-stake as a consensus mechanism and thus managed to reduce the energy used by the Ethereum ecosystem by 99%, Shapella will do something closely related.
- The Merge will also help reduce the cost of the system by 99% if it is used by users in a decentralized way.
- If Shapella enabled the switch from proof of work to consensus, Shapella would help reduce energy use by the community by 99%.
