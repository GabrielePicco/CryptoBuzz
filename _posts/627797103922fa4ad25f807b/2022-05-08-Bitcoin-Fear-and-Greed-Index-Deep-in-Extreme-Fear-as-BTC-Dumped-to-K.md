Extreme fear is back in the bitcoin landscape following the recent correction, which, data shows, could have been prompted by whales.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price has dropped to $34,000 in the past 24 hours, dropping from $33,000 to $36,000.
- The popular Fear and Greed Index has dropped into extreme fear territory again.
- It hasn't been in such a poor state since late January, when the assetâ€™s price dropped.
- Bitcoin jumped to $40,000 following the latest FOMC meeting, in which the Fed said it will raise interest rates by 50 basis points instead of 75, but that was short-lived.
- In April alone, BTC dumped by more than $10,000 and closed the month below $40k.
- Whales behind the sell-off could have been prompted by whales, data shows.
