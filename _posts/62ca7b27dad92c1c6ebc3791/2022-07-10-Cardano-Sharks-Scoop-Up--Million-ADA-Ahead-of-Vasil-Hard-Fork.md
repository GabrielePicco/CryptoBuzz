## Highlights

- The price of the Cardano (ADA) token has fallen 85% since its September 2021 record high of $3.16.
- Meanwhile, "whales" that hold between 100,000 and 1 million ADA have stopped selling.
- The recent buying spree hints that they have been positioning themselves for a sharp price rebound.
- The Cardano token could risk falling to as low as $0.31, as illustrated in the chart above.
