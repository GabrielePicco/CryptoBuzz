Large institutional investors are starting to become more comfortable with the crypto sector and pouring millions into the asset class.

## Highlights

- An eye-watering 31,130 bitcoin — worth approximately $1.2 billion — was moved away from the Coinbase exchange in the past week.
- The large rush has led to a considerable decrease in the total balance held on the San Francisco-based exchange to approximately 650,000 BTC.
- This is the same level seen during the peak of the 2017 bull run.
- In addition, total bitcoin holdings have slumped by 36.6% from the record high set in April 2020.
