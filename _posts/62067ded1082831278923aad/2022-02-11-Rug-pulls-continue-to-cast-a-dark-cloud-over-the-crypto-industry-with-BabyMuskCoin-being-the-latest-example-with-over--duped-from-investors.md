BabyMuskCoin, another memecoin created recently, became the latest rug pulled project in the cryptocurrency space.

## Highlights

- $16.56 million was lost to nine rug pulls in January of this year alone, says CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu.
- Gu is an assistant professor and assistant professor at Columbia University.
- Gu explains how to avoid rug pulls and how to read reports before you invest in a project.
- Gu: "Dev teams should implement secure coding best practices to avoid vulnerabilities that could be exploited later.
- Dev teams should be careful to avoid secure coding and ensure that their own token is not being promoted as much as the community growth and fundamentals"
