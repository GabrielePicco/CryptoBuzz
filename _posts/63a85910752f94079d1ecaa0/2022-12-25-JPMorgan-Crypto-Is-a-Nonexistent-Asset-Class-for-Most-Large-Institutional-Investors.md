A JPMorgan strategist says crypto is effectively nonexistent as an asset class for most large institutional investors.

## Highlights

- JPMorgan Asset Management’s head of institutional portfolio strategy, Jared Gross, discussed crypto and institutional investors’ interest in the asset class on Bloomberg Friday.
- “The volatility is too high, the lack of an intrinsic return that you can point to makes it very challenging,” he added.
- Growing number of banks and financial institutions are offering crypto products and services to their institutional clients.
- The market has declined significantly this year as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world raised interest rates to fight inflation.
- A study published by financial giant Fidelity in October showed that 74% of institutional investors surveyed plan to invest in digital assets.
