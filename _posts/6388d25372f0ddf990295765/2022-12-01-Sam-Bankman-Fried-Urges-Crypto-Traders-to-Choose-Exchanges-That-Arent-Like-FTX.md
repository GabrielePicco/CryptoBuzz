Bankman-Fried asked crypto investors to look for \"all the things I wish FTX had been able to supply\" when depositing their funds.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried said that investors should look for exchanges that don't do business like FTX when choosing where to deposit their funds.
- FTX filed for bankruptcy last month after a report alleged that its sister trading firm held a significant position in its native token FTT, leading to a solvency crisis.
- New CEO John Ray III slammed the group's lack of corporate controls in a Chapter 11 filing released on November 17.
- The restructuring expert – who previously oversaw the reorganization of failed energy firm Enron – said that FTX held just $659,000 worth of crypto against its claimed reserves of $5.5 billion.
