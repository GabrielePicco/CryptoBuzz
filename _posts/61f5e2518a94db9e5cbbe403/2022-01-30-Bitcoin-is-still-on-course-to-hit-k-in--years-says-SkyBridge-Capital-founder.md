Anthony Scaramucci has said Bitcoin investors should not be concerned with the asset’s correction since it has a potential to hit $500k.

## Highlights

- Anthony Scaramucci has said long-term Bitcoin investors should not be concerned with the asset’s recent correction since it has a higher potential of hitting $500,000 in five years.
- Scaramucci said Bitcoin's true value is based on the asset's growing network that will take less time to outperform gold.
- The former White House Communication Director added to the growing list of analysts who believe that the current Bitcoin correction is temporary.
- However, the asset is making minor gains, trading at $37,800 by press time.
- The hedge fund manager added that the market should expect ‘some fairly stringent’ laws, especially with the United States reportedly planning to focus on crypto regulations.
