Taxpayers will still be required to pay taxes on crypto gains and losses, but “brokers” will not be required to report their customers’ trading incomes yet.

## Highlights

- The rules were supposed to be effective in the 2023 tax filing year, in accordance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in November, 2021.
- The new law requires that the Internal Revenue Service develop a standard definition of what a “cryptocurrency broker’s” is.
- It also requires these firms to provide this same information to the IRS so that it will be aware of customers’ incomes from trading.
- However, more than 12 months have passed since the infrastructure bill became law, the IRS has still not published a definition of “brokers” or created standard forms to use in making the reports.
- The Treasury Department says that it intends to craft such rules soon.
