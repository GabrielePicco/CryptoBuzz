Senator Kempis, who appeared at this year’s Bitcoin Conference, wants digital currency in Mexico to be issued by the central bank.

## Highlights

- Indria Kempis – a Mexican senator for the State of Nuevo León – has introduced a bill to formalize the inclusion of virtual assets as a form of currency that may circulate in Mexico.
- However, she proposes that only the central bank can issue a digital currency, without any mention of Bitcoin.
- Kempis recently appeared on stage at the Bitcoin Conference to discuss Bitcoin’s adoption of legal tender in the country.
- The bill's objectives appear mostly aligned with countries like Honduras – which have shown an explicit preference for a CBDC over Bitcoin – rather than El Salvador, where Bitcoin is de facto legal tender.
- El Salvador has also adopted Bitcoin as legal tender by scrapping capital gains tax on the asset.
