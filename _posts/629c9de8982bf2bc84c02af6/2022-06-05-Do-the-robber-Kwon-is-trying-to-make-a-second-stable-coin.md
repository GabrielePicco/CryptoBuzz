One rumour suggests a new stablecoin could be coming to the Terra Luna 2.0 ecosystem in the future. But would holders want a UST 2.0?

## Highlights

- Rumours suggest a new stablecoin could be coming to the Terra Luna 2.0 ecosystem.
- UST (UST) has been de-pegged by Terra, leaving UST 96% down 96% in the Luna crash.
- There is no official TerraForm Labs plan for a new UST, but rumours have been circulating about a second stablecoin being designed.
- The Luna ecosystem does still have a stablecoin, TerraClassicUSD (UST), with Luna Classic (UST) still in place.
- However, it does remain possible that the rumour is wrong, or providing inaccurate information.
- At the time of publication, there remains no official plan for UST or TerraUSD.
