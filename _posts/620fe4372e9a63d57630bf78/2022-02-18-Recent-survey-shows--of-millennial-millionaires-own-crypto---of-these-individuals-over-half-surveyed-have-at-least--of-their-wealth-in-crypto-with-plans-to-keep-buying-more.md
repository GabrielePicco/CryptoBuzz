## Highlights

- 83% of millennial millionaires own crypto, according to a new CNBC Millionaire Survey.
- The survey found that 53% have at least 50% of their wealth in crypto.
- Only 6% of millennials plan to reduce their crypto investments over the next year.
- Older generations of millionaires are still skeptical of crypto and its future, while cryptocurrencies have become the primary source of wealth creation and asset growth for many younger investors.
- Experts point to additional reasons to additional money made by millennial millionaire investors tied to crypto, including the lack of trust in the traditional banking system tied to the Great Great Depression.
- The future belongs to the next generation, however, and it requires a whole different set of skills from an investment manager, experts say.
