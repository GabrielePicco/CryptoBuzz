Figures suggest company has paid out more than total cash on hand, as terra backers prepare relaunch

## Highlights

- Tether, the third biggest cryptocurrency by “market cap”, experienced a crisis on Thursday.
- It experienced a short-lived crisis when its value dropped from $1 to 95¢ as savers feared it would follow its fellow stablecoin terra and collapse.
- The company only allows direct withdrawals of at least $100,000 for each request, and charges a fee of 0.1% on redemptions.
- It has since largely restored its dollar peg by honouring a promise to allow savers to always withdraw $1 for every tether they give back to the company.
- Despite the difficulties, $7.6bn of tether has been reallocated in this way since Thursday.
