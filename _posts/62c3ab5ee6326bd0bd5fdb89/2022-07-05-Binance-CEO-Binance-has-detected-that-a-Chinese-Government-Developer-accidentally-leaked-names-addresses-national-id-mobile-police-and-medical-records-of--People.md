## Highlights

- 1 billion records of private citizens' data were found for sale in the dark web.
- The data includes name, address, national id, mobile, police and medical records from one asian country.
- Likely due to a bug in an Elastic Search deployment by a gov agency.
- Apparently, this exploit happened because the gov developer wrote a tech blog on CSDN and accidentally included the credentials.
