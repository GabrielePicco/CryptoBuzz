## Highlights

- Bitcoin’s price bottoming below $20K in June, the worst days of the Crypto Winter are over, according to experts Ran Neuner and Steven Sidley.
- Neuner used the 200-week moving average of Bitcoin to support his claim that the cryptocurrency would continue its upward rally.
- Sidley, a best-selling author and Director at Bridge Capital Future Advisory, cautioned that there are a couple of things still staring us in the face, including a possible Black Swan event.
- However, Neuner said that investors should watch the “macro environment,” which could impact the price of Bitcoin.
- The BlackRock announcement did not move after the announcement because of unfavorable regulatory developments, Sidley said.
