For the next month, LimeWire is offering a game inspired by its early 2000s filesharing platform with crypto and merch as prizes.

## Highlights

- The LimeWire Game simulates an old Windows operating system with LimeWire software running.
- The browser-based game involves pretending to “search” for old music and movies to download.
- The top 1,000 players will receive a total of 150,000 LMWR tokens as prizes.
- LimeWire is now a creator membership platform and NFT marketplace, where artists can paywall exclusive content for fans, similar to Patreatreatre.
- Since its launch last year, LimeWire tells Decrypt, its marketplace has seen $1 million in total volume traded, with a waitlist of 3 million users and 20,000 creators.
- The game will be available to play until May 15.
