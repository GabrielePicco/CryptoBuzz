After misplacing his digital wallet password, this man has only two more attempts before his millions are lost forever.

## Highlights

- Stefan Thomas was paid 7,002 Bitcoin for making a video explaining how the cryptocurrency worked.
- He stored the private keys to the wallet on a small hard drive, which was password protected.
- Thomas has used eight of his 10 attempts to access his Bitcoin wallet.
- He has just two more attempts left to guess the password before it's encrypted and lost forever.
- This is not the first time someone has lost millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
- Welshman James Howells accidentally threw out a hard drive filled with around $265 million worth of the cryptocurrency after it was thrown out in the local dump, hopeful that one day he will find his hard drive.
