Harmony has shared a controversial reimbursement proposal to compensate victims of the Horizon bridge exploit through inflation.

## Highlights

- Harmony has proposed a hardfork to mint more ONE tokens that would be used to compensate victims of the recent $100 million Horizon bridge exploit.
- Many community members have pushed back at the proposal, taking issue with the team's "take it or leave it" approach.
- The proposal has received overwhelming pushback from the Harmony community.
- The Layer 1 project initiated a “global manhunt” following the incident, alerting exchanges, law enforcement agencies, and blockchain analysis companies.
- It also offered the hacker a $10 million bounty to return the stolen funds.
- Despite all of its efforts, the project has failed to identify the hacker or recover funds.
