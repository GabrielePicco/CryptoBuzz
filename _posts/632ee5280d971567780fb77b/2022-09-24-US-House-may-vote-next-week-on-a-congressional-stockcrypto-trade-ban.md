Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren told colleagues that the legislation will also include a ban on Supreme Court justices trading stocks — spelling potential trouble for the bill.

## Highlights

- Democratic Rep.
- Hakeem Jeffries announced that the House may consider legislation to ban members of Congress from trading stocks as soon as next week.
- The House is voting for just 3 days next week, leaving little time for members to consider the new legislation.
- The legislation will also include a ban on Supreme Court justices, which advocates view as a potential "poison pill" for the legislation.
- Full text of the bill has not been made public, and even members who have been working on related legislation tell Insider they have yet to see text.
- The Senate version of a stock trading ban is unlikely to come until after the midterm elections, a Democratic senator told Insider last week.
