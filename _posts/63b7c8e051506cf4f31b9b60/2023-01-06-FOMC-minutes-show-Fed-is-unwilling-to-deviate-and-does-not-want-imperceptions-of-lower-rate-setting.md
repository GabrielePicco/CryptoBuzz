## Highlights

- The Fed raised its key interest rate to 4.25%-4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.
- The central bank has been reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested.
- The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy, was at 4.7% annually in November.
- Traders expect the central bank to approve a quarter-point increase at the next meeting, which concludes Feb.
- 1, according to CME Group data.
- No FOMC members expect rate cuts in 2023, despite market pricing.
