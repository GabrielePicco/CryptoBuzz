The latest crypto slump could be decisive in determining the industry’s future winners, according to one of the Bank of England's officials.

## Highlights

- Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe has likened the current crypto market crash to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.
- He suggested that the survivors could evolve into the "Amazons and eBays" of tomorrow.
- The Deputy Governor added that no matter what happens to cryptocurrencies in the coming months, he expects "crypto technology and finance to continue" He also discussed the Bank's current thinking around stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) In April 2021, the bank launched a task force to explore the potential of a CBDC with an "on or off ramp to fiat," or "flexible" to be used in private stablecoins.
