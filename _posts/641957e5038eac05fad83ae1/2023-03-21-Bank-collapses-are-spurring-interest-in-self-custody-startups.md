The implosions of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank are giving self-custody startups an opportunity to prosper, according to Jan Strandberg.

## Highlights

- The collapses of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank have left many people in disbelief.
- Jan Strandberg is the CEO of Acquireireire, where he served as chief growth officer.
- As faith in the traditional banking system wanes due to SVB causing “a crisis in confidence,” venture capital (VC) firms and startups are increasingly embracing self-custody solutions for digital assets.
- The shift is indicative of a larger trend that sees more people embracing cryptocurrencies and the principles of financial sovereignty, he says.
- This increased interest in decentralized solutions is fueling innovation and investment in the space, which is good for both the crypto ecosystem and the broader financial landscape.
