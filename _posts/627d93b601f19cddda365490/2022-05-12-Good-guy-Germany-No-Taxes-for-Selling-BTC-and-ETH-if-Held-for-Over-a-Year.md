Germany's Finance Ministry said private individuals won't have to pay taxes when selling BTC or ETH if they have held the assets for more than a year.

## Highlights

- The German Ministry of Finance has made certain amendments to its cryptocurrency policies.
- The sale of acquired bitcoin and ether wonâ€™t be taxed if individuals hold the assets for more than one year.
- The policy will apply even if the cryptocurrencies have been employed for staking/lending.
- Previously, digital assets used in such activities had to be held for ten years to be exempt from taxation.
- The Ministry outlined that this is the first time the subject has been addressed with a nationwide administrative instruction.
- The officials vowed to keep dealing with the digital asset taxation policy and eliminate any arising issues.
