Meta is ditching its NFT plans to prioritize on other means of helping creators and businesses connect with and monetize userbases.

## Highlights

- NFTs will be easier to use natively on Instagram and Facebook to connect with creators.
- Users will be able to pay for their work using the social network's payment system.
- The social network is focusing on other ways of connecting users with each other.
- It will also streamline payments and make it easier to make payments easier for creators to use the platform.
- In November, Instagram announced plans for a Polygon-supported NFT marketplace as part of the plan to use Facebook and Instagram to connect more with creators and their friends.
- The site is now focusing on its social network platform, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter.
