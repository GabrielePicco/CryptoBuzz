Crypto's biggest critics often argue that the digital assets have virtually no intrinsic value, that the technology underlying it has failed to prove its usefulness, and that the market for digital currency is built on little more than hype.

## Highlights

- A report by a hedge fund says the market for digital currency is built on little more than hype.
- But it doesn't mean you can’t make money from it.
- The report was published by researchers at Starkiller Capital, a crypto-focused hedge fund.
- It says crypto is essentially a “hot ball of money” bouncing from one digital asset to the next, driven by an ever-shifting narrative about innovation and potential future value.
- For now, crypto is a pure momentum play — and not one for the faint of heart, the report says.
- It might seem odd for a digital-asset-focused firm to publish a report on how crypto is basically a hype beast.
