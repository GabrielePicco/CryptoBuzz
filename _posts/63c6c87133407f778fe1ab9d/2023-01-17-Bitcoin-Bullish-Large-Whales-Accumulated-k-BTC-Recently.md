On-chain data shows large Bitcoin whales have finally started accumulating in the last 10 days as BTC has rallied strong.

## Highlights

- On-chain data shows large Bitcoin whales have finally started accumulating in the last 10 days as BTC has rallied strong.
- Holders with balances in this range are usually called “sharks” In this recent period of strong accumulation, these sharks have added 105,600 BTC to their holdings so far.
- The 1,000-10,000 coins group could still be the one to watch for, as things could take a quick bearish turn if these large whales start distributing again.
- At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $20,800, up 20% in last week.
- The value of the crypto seems to have moved sideways in last couple of days.
