Attorneys allege O'Neal has been dodging being served for months, and that a process server \"was sent an ominous and threatening text message by O'Neal or someone acting on his behalf.\"

## Highlights

- Shaquille O'Neal is the only defendant in a class-action lawsuit brought against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a host of celebrity spokespeople.
- The plaintiff's attorneys have unsuccessfully attempted to serve the "Inside the NBA" analyst in person for months, court documents allege.
- The four-time NBA champion has denied being involved in FTX beyond his sponsorship deal.
- A Florida judge denied the request to serve O'Shaquille in person, citing two cases where a court permitted service under the laws of another state.
- The class action was filed in the wake of the collapse of FTX, accusing FTX of defrauding investors.
