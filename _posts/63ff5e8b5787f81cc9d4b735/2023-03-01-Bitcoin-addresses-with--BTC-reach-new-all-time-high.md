Bitcoin (BTC) — the world's first cryptocurrency — keeps leaving cryptocurrency exchanges as on-chain data keeps showing signs of accumulation by long-term investors.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) keeps leaving cryptocurrency exchanges as on-chain data keeps showing signs of accumulation by long-term investors.
- Data provided by blockchain analytics platform Glassnode shows that the percentage of bitcoin that has not been moved for at least one year just reached a new all-time high of 67.037%.
- Data also shows that over the last 24 hours $620.8 million was sent to crypto exchanges and $678.5 million was moved out of them, resulting in a net outflow of $57.6 million.
- All of this data point to an increasingly shrinking bitcoin’s real supply, as many old wallets with significant holdings are not likely to ever come back to life.
