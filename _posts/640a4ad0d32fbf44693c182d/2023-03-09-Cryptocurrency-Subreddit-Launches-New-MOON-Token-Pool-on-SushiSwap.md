Following a recent governance proposal, SushiSwap is rolling out a new rewards program in partnership with r/CryptoCurrency.

## Highlights

- The popular subreddit r/CryptoCurrency has joined SushiSwapâ€™s dual rewards program Onsen to provide liquidity providers with exchange fees, SUSHI, and MOON rewards.
- The key objective, according to a governance post from February, is to deepen the MOON token liquidity.
- MOON is the native token of the popular subreddit, the largest crypto-focused community on Reddit, with over 6.1 million users.
- The tokens can be stored on Reddit's mobile app-based crypto wallet called Vault, which is compatible with the MetaMask wallet.
- The additional rewards will increase the circulating supply of MOON by 0.5% at the current rate.
