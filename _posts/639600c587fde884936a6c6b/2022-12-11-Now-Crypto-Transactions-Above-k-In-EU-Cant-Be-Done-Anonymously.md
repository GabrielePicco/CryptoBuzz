European Union Limits Cash Purchases and Increases Scrutiny on Crypto Transactions. Read This Full Report

## Highlights

- European Union is a very big market for the crypto sector.
- EU Members of the bloc announced that new laws will restrict crypto purchases worth above €10,000.
- New laws will prohibit crypto assets sell or purchase beyond €1,000 and also will strictly monitor the crypto transactions to fight against illegal crypto fund transactions.
- New AML rules will not be applicable on Defi (Decentralised Finance) because it is the nature of all the Defi protocols where people can trade in any amount without any limit or restriction.
- But there may be chances that Defi developers may face regulatory action heat in this situation if they will be based in the EU.
