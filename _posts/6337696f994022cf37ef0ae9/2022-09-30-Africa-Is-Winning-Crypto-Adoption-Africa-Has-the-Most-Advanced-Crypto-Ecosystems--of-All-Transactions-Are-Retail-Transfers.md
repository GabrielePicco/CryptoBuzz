Sub-Saharan Africa has low crypto transaction volumes, but some of the most advanced crypto ecosystems, according to Chainalysis.

## Highlights

- Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest cryptocurrency transactions compared to any other region, according to Chainalysis findings.
- P2P exchanges account for 6% of all transactions in Africa, more than double the share of the next-closest region, Central & Southern Asia and Oceania.
- India fell from the second-largest crypto-loving population to fourth spot year-on-year according to another report by the analytics firm.
- The report finds that crypto usage this year is driven by daily necessity as opposed to speculation by the wealthy, as per Chainalysis.
- The analytics firm anticipates that the use of cryptocurrencies in the continent is set to increase as long as regulations, economic volatility, and the need for cross-border transactions remain.
