One of the world’s poorest countries, the Central African Republic, has become the second nation to adopt Bitcoin as official currency. It follows El Salvador’s adoption of the cryptocurrency last year.

## Highlights

- Central African Republic is the second-ever country to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency.
- It follows El Salvador’s adoption of the cryptocurrency last year.
- Analysts and financial experts are confused by motivations for the move.
- CAR is a landlocked nation rich in resources like gold and uranium, but remains one of the world's poorest countries.
- It is one of six states in Africa to use the Central African CFA franc as its currency, which is backed by France and pegged to the Euro.
- Others say the move could be tied to CAR's close relationship with Russia, which has been criticized for deploying mercenaries from Russia to fight rebel groups.
