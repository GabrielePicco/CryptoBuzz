Company argued betting platform was a valuable resource of information

## Highlights

- Online gamblers bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on the fate of the Titanic submarine.
- Gamblers wagered at least $300,000 on the outcome of the vessel using the crypto platform Polymarket.
- Polymarket defended its offerings on the submarine, arguing that it was a neutral way of calculating the likelihood of a rescue.
- Company argued betting platform was a valuable resource of information to the families of the missing vessel.
- Most major bookmakers refused to take bets regarding the death of Queen Elizabeth, according to Betting Gods, a gambling industry tip site, because they would rather bet on sports than the queen's death.
- The site said it would not take bets on the Queen dying as it would offend its regular customers.
