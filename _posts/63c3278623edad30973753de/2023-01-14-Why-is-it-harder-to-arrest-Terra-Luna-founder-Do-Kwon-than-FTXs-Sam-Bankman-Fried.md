South Korea’s attempts to extradite the founder of the collapsed Terra-Luna stablecoin will remain hamstrung while the courts in Seoul dispute the charges against him.

## Highlights

- Terra-Luna founder Kwon Do-hyung is reportedly living in Serbia despite an Interpol 'Red Notice' for his arrest.
- South Korea and Serbia do not have an extradition agreement.
- Lawyer says attempts to extradite Do Kwon from Serbia have failed because prosecutors have so far been unable to convince a court in Seoul that the charges against him can stand.
- If a South Korean court acknowledges the Luna token as a security it may then hold that financial regulators were negligent and have a responsibility in the collapse, lawyer Koo Tae-on says.
- Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-seung has not shown any activity on the social media platform since Dec.
- 11.
