What FTX customers lost may not impoverish them, but they were still cheated.

## Highlights

- Greg Sanders was one of an estimated 9 million customers who kept some or all of their crypto holdings with Sam Bankman-Fried’s Bahamas-based exchange group, FTX.
- The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the U.S.
- Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York have charged FTX with a long list of crimes.
- Despite thousands of people losing an estimated total of $8 billion in the debacle, just a handful of stories about those who have been defrauded have surfaced in the press.
- Sanders, who lives in northwest Arkansas, began stock-picking when he was in college.
