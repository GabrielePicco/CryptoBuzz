Asset management giant Fidelity is on the lookout for 100 new crypto talented people by Q1 2023, as the firm plans to expand its digital asset solutions amid increased client interest.

## Highlights

- Fidelity Investments is reportedly set to hire another 100 people to bolster its digital assets division.
- The firm plans to expand its digital asset-related team to 500 by the end of the first quarter of 2023.
- Fidelityâ€™s hiring spree comes as some of the largest crypto-native firms lay off a spree of employees, having cut 20%, 18% and 10% of their crypto-talent.
- The move comes amid increased client interest in Fidelity's offerings to offer Bitcoin (BTC) trading services to its 34 million retail customers.
- It has already launched a service that enables its 401(k) retirement saving account holders to invest directly into Bitcoin.
