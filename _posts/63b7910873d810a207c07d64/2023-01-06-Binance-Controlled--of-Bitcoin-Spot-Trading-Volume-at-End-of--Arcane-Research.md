A summer move to eliminate bitcoin trading fees and the collapse of rival exchange FTX pushed even more investors to the Binance platform.

## Highlights

- A summer move to eliminate bitcoin trading fees and the collapse of rival FTX pushed even more investors to the Binance platform.
- A market share this high could become problematic for the industry if Binance were to encounter any issues, whether regulatory or mistrust from users.
- The exchange did suffer some outflows for a short period, though things have stabilized since.
- The market share has been high since FTX's collapse in July, but it is expected to stabilize after a long period of outflows from Binance.
