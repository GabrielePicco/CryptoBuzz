Mastercard will on Tuesday launch a new product called Crypto Secure that helps banks assess the risk of crime associated with crypto merchants on its network.

## Highlights

- Mastercard will on Tuesday debut a new piece of software that helps banks identify and cut off transactions from fraud-prone crypto exchanges.
- Called Crypto Secure, the system uses "sophisticated" artificial intelligence algorithms to determine the risk of crime associated with crypto exchanges on the Mastercard payment network.
- System relies on data from the blockchain, a public record of crypto transactions, as well as other sources.
- The payments giant is doubling down on crypto at a time when prices of digital currencies are falling and volumes have dried up.
- The entire market has shed roughly $2 trillion in value since the peak of a huge rally in November 2021, according to Chainalysis data.
