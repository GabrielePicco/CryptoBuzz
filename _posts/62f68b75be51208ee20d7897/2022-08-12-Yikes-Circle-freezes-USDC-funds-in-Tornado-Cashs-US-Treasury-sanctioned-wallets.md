The USD Coin (USDC) issuer has frozen USDC funds in Ethereum wallet addresses held by sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash.

## Highlights

- USD Coin (USDC) issuer has frozen USDC funds in Bitcoin wallet addresses held by Tornado Cash.
- Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury for allegedly helping to launder proceeds from crypto hacks for the North Korean hacking syndicate called Lazarus Group.
- Centre, the consortium behind the USD Coin, has blacklisted the addresses of Tornado Cash's USDC pool.
- The consortium does this by calling a function called “blacklist(address investor)” This is because when Centre blacklists an address, the owner becomes unable to receive or transfer USDC money on-chain from that address.
- This is not the first time that Centre has blacklisted wallet addresses due to law enforcement or regulatory action.
