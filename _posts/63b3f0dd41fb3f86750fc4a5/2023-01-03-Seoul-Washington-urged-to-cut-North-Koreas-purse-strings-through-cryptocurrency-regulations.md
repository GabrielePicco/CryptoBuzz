North Korea made headlines in 2022 by firing more ballistic missiles than any other year - 38 launches. But besides its ceaseless saber-rattling, the isolated country was also in the spotlight for its illegal cyber activities that allegedly raked in billions of dollars.

## Highlights

- North Korea stole $1.75 billion (2.2 trillion won) worth of cryptocurrency between 2017 and 2020, experts say.
- Experts say Pyongyang's cyber capabilities are not as sophisticated as before, adding a shift in cyber-raid targets has led its cyber capabilities astray.
- Experts skeptical whether North Korean regime is walking away with large chunk of money taken from illicit activities.
- North Korea's nuclear, missile and intelligence operations now benefit from the resources these crimes generate for them, they say.
- The only questions remaining are the exact amounts of stolen crypto thefts and how much of the stolen currency is able to be converted into traditional currencies, they said.
