Ethereum will probably become deflationary as token issuance decreases while the burn mechanism is maintained, the bank said.

## Highlights

- The Merge, the first of five planned upgrades for the network, may increase transaction speeds by only 10% by reducing block times.
- The upgrade lays the path for the ‘Surge’, which promises to bring 100,000 transactions-per-second (TPS) capability to the blockchain, the report said.
- The next planned upgrade, the “Surge,” is the next planned upgrades to the network and promises to be able to deliver 100,00 transactions per second (TPS) capability.
- The bank said the upgrade will probably become deflationary as token issuance decreases while the burn mechanism is maintained, the bank said.
