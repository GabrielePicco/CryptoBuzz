Coinbase's end goal is to make it easier for developers to build useful dapps and bolster their distribution.

## Highlights

- Jump Crypto has seemingly recovered 120.69k wstETH and 3.21k rETH ($225M of assets) from the infamous Wormhole Exploit that occurred one year ago.
- A recovery group, what appears to be Jump Crypto and Oasis, “counter exploited” an upgradable proxy contract on the Oasis protocol, securing the stolen funds and transferring them to a fresh wallet.
- Jump Crypto nor Oasis have publicly confirmed this.
- The Wormhole.
