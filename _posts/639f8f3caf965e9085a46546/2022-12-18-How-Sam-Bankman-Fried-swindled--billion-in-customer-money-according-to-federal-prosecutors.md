Bankman-Fried's swift fall from hero to villain of the crypto sector exposed a years-long fraud that traced back to FTX's launch in 2019, according to authorities.

## Highlights

- FTX and Alameda traded tokens, valued at $16 billion a day, according to the SEC.
- FTX controlled the vast majority of the available currency, with only a small amount of FTT circulating at any time.
- Alameda's losses and lending structure were a critical component of FTX's eventual collapse.
- The hedge fund borrowed aggressively from multiple lenders, including Voyager Digital and BlockFi Lending.
- Both those companies entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings this year, and FTX targeted both for acquisition.
- Alameda lost over $3.7 billion over its lifetime, despite public statements by FTX leaders touting how profitable the trading arm was.
