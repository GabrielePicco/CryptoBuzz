The crypto markets are in chaos again, and the liquidations have skyrocketed to over $600 million in the past 24 hours.

## Highlights

- The number of wrecked traders is north of 160,000 on a daily scale, according to data from Coinglass.
- The entire crypto market cap has seen almost $100 billion gone since Friday evening and is just over $800 billion now.
- The total wrecked positions are worth over $600 million, with the largest single one occurring on Bitmex ($7.5M) with the ETH/USD trading pair.
- The primary cryptocurrency lost the coveted $20,000 line and even dropped below the 2017 ATH on Saturday morning.
- The alternative coins have suffered even more, with multiple double-digit losses evident from the likes of ETH, AVAX, BNB, and more.
