The deal is a sign Executive Chairman Michael Saylor isn't backing off his audacious plan to turn his software developer into a bitcoin proxy.

## Highlights

- MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor stepped down as CEO to become executive chairman and focus on buying bitcoin.
- Since 2020, he's used money raised from stock and bond offerings to purchase about 130,000 bitcoin, worth more than $2 billion.
- The deal is the first tangible sign that Saylor isn't backing off his audacious plan to turn his software developer into a bitcoin proxy.
- The timing stands out because it's the first sign that founder Saylor really is not backing of his plan to buy bitcoin.
