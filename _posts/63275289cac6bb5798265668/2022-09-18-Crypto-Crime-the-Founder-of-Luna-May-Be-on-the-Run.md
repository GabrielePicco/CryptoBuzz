Luna and its sister token UST collapsed in May. An arrest warrant for their main founder has been issued.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon is accused of fraud and violating local market laws in South Korea.
- He founded Luna and its sister token UST, which collapsed in May, wiping out at least $55 billion of market cap.
- Authorities in U.S., South Korea and South Korea have launched investigations.
- Kwon says he is not on the run and is cooperating with authorities.
- But South Korean authorities dispute his account, saying he flew to Singapore in April to avoid arrest warrant for him.
- He has a Singaporean work permit which expires on Dec.
