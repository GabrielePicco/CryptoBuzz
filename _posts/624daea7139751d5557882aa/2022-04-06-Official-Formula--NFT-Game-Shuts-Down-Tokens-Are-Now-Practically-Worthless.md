Hello, and welcome to another episode of 'dumb crypto stuff not working in the real world'

## Highlights

- F1 Delta Time, an official NFT and crypto-powered racing game that launched back in 2019, closed its doors last month.
- This leaves everyone who had spent money and invested in the project probably wishing they had done something else with their time.
- The developers have promised the owners of those F1 NFTs that they can now have some generic replacement tokens for an entirely different racing game instead.
- The most expensive NFT sold in all of 2019 was a car for this game, which went for over $100,000.
- Some players would later spend almost $300,000 on a transaction—but without the game they were bought for there’s no actual value there.
