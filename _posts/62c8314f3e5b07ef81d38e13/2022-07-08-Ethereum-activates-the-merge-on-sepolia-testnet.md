With the Sepolia testnet merge, Ethereum developers have take another step closer to the merge on the main blockchain later this year.

## Highlights

- Sepolia, one of Ethereum's public testnet, has undergone the merge.
- With this, developers have take another step closer to the merge on the main blockchain later this year.
- Sepoliaâ€™s proof-of-work chain (execution layer) "merged" with its proof of-stake beacon chain (consensus layer) at around 2 PM UTC.
- The same process is set to happen with the mainnet merge event.
- There is now only the Goerli testnet left to be merged in the coming weeks, it is expected to happen before the end of the year.
- The exercise was to check if the validator nodes from Sepolia's two chains can work together.
