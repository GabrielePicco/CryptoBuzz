Ukraine’s government has stopped its citizens from buying crypto with local currency in a bid to combat capital flight.

## Highlights

- Citizens can now only buy crypto using foreign currency up to $3,400 per month.
- This will help stop capital flight, the National Bank of Ukraine said.
- The move is to prevent "unproductive capital outflows," the NBU said in a statement.
- Ukraine has received millions in cryptocurrency donations from around the world from NGOs and volunteer groups since Russia invaded the country in February.
- Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law "On Virtual Assets" legalizing cryptocurrency assets in the country.
- The move was to help play a "vital role in Ukraine's defense process," Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Alex Bornyakov said.
