Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says he feels optimistic about the crypto regulatory landscape in the United States.

## Highlights

- Brian Armstrong says he feels optimistic about the crypto regulatory landscape in the United States.
- Armstrong acknowledged there could be more crypto regulatory clarity overall, though he still thinks the US is headed in the right direction.
- Armstrong: "There’s cause for optimism though as well, and one thing is that in Biden's recent executive order, they did ask for various departments of the government in the US to come back and say, ‘We need clarity on this industry.’ It was very positive to see them also mention that we need to protect the innovation potential of this technology because this represents a huge opportunity where we want to preserve this in the U.S.
