title:  "President Biden wants to know more about cryptocurrencies before creating a digital dollar"
description: "The White House is set to start working on a strategy to study and regulate cryptocurrency, while also looking into developing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Coming off the back of a Federal Reserve report (PDF warning) into a digital dollar, and according to a report in Yahoo Finance, President Biden will issue an executive order on cryptocurrency oversight next week.The executive order will reportedly commission a study into the US creating its own 'digital dollar' or CBDC, along with tasking numerous agencies across the government to develop reports on payment systems, environmental impact, financial stability issues, and other risks that all come with dealing with crypto. The White House's full-court press on crypto seems to involve tasking government agencies—such as the Departments of Treasury and Homeland Security—to address many issues and concerns that arise when dealing with digital currency on a serious level over the long term. The Office of Science and Technology will be in charge of producing a report on distributed ledger technology (aka the blockchain) within 180 days, and then on its subsequent effect on the environment in less than two years. The FTC is looking at potential privacy issues regarding digital assets."
