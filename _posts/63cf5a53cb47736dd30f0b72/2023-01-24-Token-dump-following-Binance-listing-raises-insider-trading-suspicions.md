Insider trading becomes a hot topic for crypto amid Coinbase-linked first conviction of crypto insider trading and now Binance listing-related token movement has raised suspicion.

## Highlights

- CoinCoin CEO Conor Grogan flagged transaction activity of a few anonymous wallets linked to Binance listings.
- The anonymous wallets allegedly bought multiple unlisted tokens minutes before their listing announcement on Binance and dumped them right after the announcement.
- Grogan speculated that this could likely be from a “rogue employee connected to the listings team who would have details on new asset announcements or a trader who found some sort of API or staging /test trade exchange leak.” Binance recently revealed a 90-day token sale policy for employees, prohibiting them or their family members from selling any newly listed token in the mentioned time frame.
- Binance has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.
