The choice not to challenge Grayscale Investments’ Court of Appeals win is among the bullish signs for eventual spot bitcoin ETF approval

## Highlights

- The Securities and Exchange Commission did not appeal a court win by Grayscale Investments Friday.
- The decision could be a sign that spot bitcoin ETF approval is imminent, analysts say.
- Recent amendments to bitcoin ETF proposals also appear to reflect progress.
- The 240-day window for the SEC to decide on a spot bitcoinETF proposed by Ark Invest and 21Shares expires on Jan.
- 10.
- The ultimate deadline for it to weigh in on other plans by BlackRock, Fidelity and several other firms is roughly two months later, though decisions on those could also come in January, or sooner, may come in mid-January, or before the end of January.
