The Ethereum network's core developers successfully implemented to most recent update through a hard fork.

## Highlights

- The Shapella upgrade has gone live, allowing users and validators to withdraw their staked ether (ETH) on the network.
- The first major change to the network since The Merge last year marks a significant change for the community.
- Not all of the 18 million ETH ($33 billion) staked on network will be available for withdrawal all at once due to limits on the amount that can be withdrawn.
- The release of ETH could result in short-term price fluctuations, but some users may not want to sell at a loss.
- The network has completed its transition to proof-of-stake consensus with the implementation of EIP 4895.
