While most victims of crypto and NFT fraud will not get their investments back, they may be able to take advantage of some tax benefits. Tax attorney Steven Chung shares how fraud victims can use theft loss deductions to offset ordinary income.

## Highlights

- Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has limited use of theft loss deduction for personal losses.
- Taxpayer victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi-type investment schemes may be able to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Some taxpayers will not be happy with taking a capital loss, as they may not have capital gains to offset the losses.
- IRSâ€™ definitive guidance concerning the US tax treatment of cryptocurrency is in Notice 2014-21.
- It states that, in general, such currency is treated like property, so the price paid for the cryptocurrency becomes the cost basis.
- If it is later sold, there is a capital gain or loss on the transaction.
