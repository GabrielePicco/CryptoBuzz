Bitcoin could easily go to $100,000 or more before reversing to put in its expected lows, says BTC price analysis.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) may not crash below $30,000 and instead jump to $100,000 before sweeping its lows.
- Popular trader Credible Crypto mapped out a move to a new macro top of between $100k and $200k for BTC/USD before a drawdown which could take liquidity at $30k or under.
- In previous years, such as in 2019, Bitcoin succeeded in returning to the upside when the market expected a capitulation event.
- However, the pair could equally surprise the market but continue on its bull run to new all-time highs and even six figures.
- The same conclusion formed the basis of research by on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant.
