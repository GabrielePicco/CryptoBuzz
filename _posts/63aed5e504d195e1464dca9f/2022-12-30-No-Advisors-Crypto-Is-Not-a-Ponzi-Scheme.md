While the FTX debacle has many Ponzi-like characteristics, most cryptocurrencies don't resemble the infamous schemes.

## Highlights

- FTX debacle has many Ponzi-like characteristics, but most cryptocurrencies don't resemble the infamous schemes.
- Most cryptocurrencies donâ€™t resemble the notorious schemes.
- When the original investors want to withdraw their funds, their investments are returned through funds invested by subsequent rounds of investors, giving the illusion of solvency and returns.
- The FTX fiasco has many similarities to the infamous FTSB scam, but not all of the similarities to those involved in the FTX scandal.
