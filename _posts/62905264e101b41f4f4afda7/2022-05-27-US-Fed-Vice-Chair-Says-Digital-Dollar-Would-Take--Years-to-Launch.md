The Federal Reserve’s Lael Brainard says it will take years to build a U.S. CBDC and that the project can only start once Congress and the White House sign off.

## Highlights

- The Federal Reserve’s Lael Brainard says it will take years to build a U.S.
- CBDC.
- Brainard said it's “probably preferable not to have an interest-bearing digital currency," answering bankers’ concerns that a digital dollar could take a massive and potentially fatal bite out of their deposit business.
- She also mentioned the Fed is considering caps on digital dollar holdings to encourage customers to use them only for payments and not as a safe asset for people or businesses to pile their money into.
