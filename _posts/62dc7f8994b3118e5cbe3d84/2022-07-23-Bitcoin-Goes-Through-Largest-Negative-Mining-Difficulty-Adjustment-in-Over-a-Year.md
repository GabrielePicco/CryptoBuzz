The metric has charted its longest-negative streak in about a year, but it could actually be expected.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin mining difficulty just went through its largest negative readjustment in over a year, declining by over 5%.
- The difficulty is down to just under 27.69T after peaking above 31T in mid-May.
- The hash rate has also decreased lately, which is somewhat normal given the fact that many miners have struggled lately.
- Iranâ€™s government reportedly decided to ban mining for the next several months due to the rising temperature and electric consumption.
- The metric has charted its longest-negative streak in about a year but it could actually be expected to be expected, BitInfoCharts reports.
- The latest adjustment, which happened hours ago, decreased the difficulty by 5.01%.
