Crypto exchange Coinbase filed a petition asking the SEC to examine how crypto works differently from traditional financial securities.

## Highlights

- “Crypto assets that are securities need an updated rulebook,” Coinbase said.
- The SEC’s “worst” approach was its case against Ripple, according to Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad.
- He said the rapid growth of the crypto industry isn’t being met with equally robust regulations.
- The exchange has filed a petition asking the SEC to examine how crypto works differently from traditional financial securities.
- It also asks the regulator to take into account that cryptocurrencies trade 24/7, unlike securities on traditional exchanges.
- Separately on Thursday, the SEC announced insider trading charges against former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi.
