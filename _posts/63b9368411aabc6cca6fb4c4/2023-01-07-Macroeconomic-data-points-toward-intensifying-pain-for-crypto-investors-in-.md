## Highlights

- By January 2022, the stock market had already started showing cracks due to the increasing pressure of imminent tapering, which also negatively impacted crypto prices.
- M2 money supply of the U.S.
- dollar turned negative in November 2022 for the first time in 28 years.
- Average recession since 1857 lasted 17 months, with the six recessions since 1980 lasting less than ten months.
- This recession technically began in August 2022 with two-quarters of negative GDP growth.
