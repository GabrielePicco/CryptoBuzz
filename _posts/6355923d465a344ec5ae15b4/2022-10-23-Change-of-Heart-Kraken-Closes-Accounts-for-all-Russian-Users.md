Following the latest package of sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia, Kraken terminated services to Russian customers.

## Highlights

- US-based cryptocurrency exchange has terminated services to Russian customers.
- Decision follows latest package of sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
- Other exchanges including CryptoCom and CryptoCom have already ended ties with Russian users.
- The move comes as a result of the latest round of sanctions imposed by the European Union against the largest country by landmass for its involvement in the countryâ€™s military campaign in Ukraine, which started in February, causing Western nations to impose financial and economic sanctions on the aggressor to try to make it back off, but with little-to-no success so far.
- The European Union imposed new sanctions against Russia earlier this month included outlawing all cryptocurrency transactions between Russians and European wallet providers.
