Exchanges should introduce decentralized finance to their centralized models to protect their customers and restore confidence in cryptocurrency.

## Highlights

- Business model that cryptocurrency exchanges currently use relies on ignorance and fear, says Bas Bas Basa Basa.
- Basa is calling on exchanges to take the decentralized way forward by creating a hybrid system that protects customers as well as their own brands.
- The sooner customers become educated on crypto, the sooner they’ll find themselves on a direct pathway to complete decentralization, he says.
- He says: It’s not your money if the bank owns it; if an exchange lets go of the fear of the responsibility it holds it, it's not your choice if it owns it.Basa is the director of the global communications and PR agency Xwecan, a global PR agency.
