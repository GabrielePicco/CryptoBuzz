Cheaper GPUs are good for gamers but bad for Nvidia's bottom line.

## Highlights

- Nvidia announced preliminary results for its second-quarter financial results.
- The company missed a previously forecasted $8.1 billion, a miss of $1.4 billion.
- Nvidia blamed this shortfall on weaker-than-expected demand for its gaming products.
- This drop can be attributed partly to a crash in the value of mining-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
- Nvidia's data center revenue is projected to be up 61 percent from last year, from $2.37 billion to $3.81 billion.
- By contrast, AMD grew its quarterly gaming revenue from $11.3 billion last year to $1.7 billion this year.
