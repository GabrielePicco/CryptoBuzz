According Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the exchange planned to change its token listing process over the next few quarters “to try and prevent on-chain data giving signal to watchful traders,” allow users to rate and review assets, and invest more in forensic tools.

## Highlights

- Some crypto sleuths made allegations of insider trading by individuals potentially connected to Coinbase.
- CEO Brian Armstrong said the crypto exchange would change some of its token listing practices.
- Armstrong did not confirm whether any Coinbase employees had received disciplinary action or been referred for criminal charges.
- He added that the exchange wouldn’t “catch everything,” but would aim to work with other crypto firms and respond to feedback to adjust policies as needed.
- A Cointelegraph report alleged certain investors had insider knowledge of which tokens Coinbase was considering listing in the second quarter of 2022 based on blockchain records of purchases prior to the exchange releasing that information.
- A listing can often result in a sudden price surge for a crypto project.
