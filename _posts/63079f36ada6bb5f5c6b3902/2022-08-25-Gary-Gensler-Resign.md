The SEC needs a leader who provides transparency, applies the law as written, and honors the Constitution.

## Highlights

- SEC Chairman Gary Gensler doubles-down on the distortions which twerked the market in the first place: opaque, inconsistent, and arbitrary policies.
- The SEC has not developed forthright policy on cryptocurrency; Congress has not instructed it to do so; and commissioners have never voted on a position.
- The agency’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office flippantly rejects investors’ good faith request for clarity and information.
- The SEC needs a leader who provides transparency, and honors the law as written, and applies the rule of law, says CQ-Roll Call's Jeff Yang.
- Yang: The SEC should resign now to avoid further damage.
