The Cardano blockchain has successfully implemented its Vasil hard fork after months of delays, Cardano says new features in the update will be available after one epoch lasting about five days.

## Highlights

- The Cardano hard fork has finally gone live as of Thursday at 9:44 pm UTC UTC.
- New features in the update will be available after one epoch lasting about five days.
- The announcement of the successful launch sent the price of Cardanoâ€™s ADA upwards by nearly 4% over the last 24 hours to $0.46 according to CoinGecko data.
- Upgrades to its Plutus smart contracts for increased efficiency also allow decentralized applications to deploy and run at lower costs.
- The upgrade was delayed due to issues on the testnet caused by bugs in a prior node version creating compatibility issues.
- New capabilities will become available for developers on the mainnet on Sept.
