The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network in March will focus exclusively on ether (ETH) withdrawals.

## Highlights

- Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network will focus exclusively on ether (ETH) withdrawals.
- Shanghai is an upgrade that will open validator staking withdrawals, a feature presently missing from the network.
- Users will be able to access coins that have been staked on the network, which became inaccessible as part of The Merge when the network transitioned to proof-of-stake consensus in September.
- To ensure that developers are able to meet the March schedule, they aim to release a public test network for the Shanghai upgrade by the end of February, according to a research associate at Galaxy who was on the call.
- Developers agreed not to consider adding EOF (EOF) to the network's EVM programming environment.
