The Ethereum community faces the possibility of a miner-led fork that will split the network as it transitions to proof-of-stake.

## Highlights

- The community faces the possibility of a miner-led fork that will split the network as it transitions to proof-of-stake consensus.
- Chandler Guo, an influential Chinese crypto miner and investor, declared on Twitter last week he would fork the Ethereum blockchain to what he called “ETH POW,” allowing miners to continue operations after the merge.
- The merge, which is planned for the coming months, will transition the network from proof of work (PoW) consensus to proof of stake.
- Developers have long anticipated that the merge would be unpopular with miners and made arrangements to counter their interference.
- But while miners can’t stop the merge, they can clone the network and create their own version.
