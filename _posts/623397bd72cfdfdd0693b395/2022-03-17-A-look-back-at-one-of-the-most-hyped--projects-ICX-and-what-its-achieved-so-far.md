ICX launched in 2017 as one of the most hyped and promising crypto projects to ever exist. With roughly around a $0.10 ICO launch price, it quickly catapulted itself all the way to $13.00, even…

## Highlights

- ICX launched in 2017 as one of the most hyped and promising crypto projects to ever exist.
- However, it has struggled since then, with its price fluctuating wildly way below this mark and many investors & P-Reps leaving the ecosystem.
- For a project that claims to be the biggest interoperability crypto in the entire space for the past 5 years, it hasn’t produced even a single working product to “hyperconnect the world”, but I’m still mega bullish cause the team made all these promises!
- Let’s start off with some basic on chain analysis before looking at some of their past promises!
