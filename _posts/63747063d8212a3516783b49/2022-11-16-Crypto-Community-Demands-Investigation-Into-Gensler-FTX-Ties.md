The crypto community is petitioning U.S. Congress to investigate connections between SEC chair Gary Gensler and the failed exchange FTX.

## Highlights

- Individuals have sent over 9,000 messages urging an investigation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's ties to FTX.
- Little is publicly known about the nature of their relationship with the failed exchange.
- The contents of their discussions are still unknown, but the contents are still largely unknown.
- The public is calling for a congressional investigation into the SEC Chair’s relationship with FTX and its officers.
- There is no evidence that FTX was granted conditional no-action relief by the SEC, but there is no indication that it was granted this consideration by the exchange, according to SEC documents.
- The petition template notes that “evidence has emerged” that.
