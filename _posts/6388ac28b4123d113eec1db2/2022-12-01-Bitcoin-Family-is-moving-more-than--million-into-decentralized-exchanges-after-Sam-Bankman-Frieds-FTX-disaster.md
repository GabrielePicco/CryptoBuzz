Didi Taihuttu and his family have relocated to Phuket, and they're still true believers even after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire.

## Highlights

- Family living on 0.3 bitcoin a month, buying back bitcoin that they sold when it was trading at $55,000 a year ago.
- Taihuttu family has largely relied on cold storage to safeguard their tokens for the last six years.
- The family declined to say how much they hold in precarious crypto, but they did disclose how much of their portfolio is in cold storage.
- They also keep 27% of their crypto holdings "hot" on centralized exchanges such as Kraken, where it is one of the oldest exchanges, and 73% of the family's total crypto storage is cold storage, which are spread around the globe, which they did not disclose.
