“We’re perfectly happy to let this go to trial,” the attorney defending Ryder Ripps in the Yuga Labs lawsuit, told Decrypt.

## Highlights

- Artist Ryder Ripps has hired lawyer Louis Tompros to defend Bored Ape Yacht Club's trademark infringement lawsuit against the company.
- Lawyer is known for representing Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie in multiple suits against far-right organizations accused of co-opting Pepe as a racist and white supremacist meme.
- The company has hired prominent Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West, the favored IP litigation firm of tech titans Facebook, Amazon, Apple, eBay, and Oracle, to represent the company in its suit against the artist.
- The lawyer will likely frame the case as an issue of artistic freedom and will try to defend the suit.
