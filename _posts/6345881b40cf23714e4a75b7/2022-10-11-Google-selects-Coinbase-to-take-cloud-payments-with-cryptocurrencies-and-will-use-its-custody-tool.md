By lining up a broad deal with Coinbase, Google might pick up an edge against Amazon and Microsoft by letting clients pay with Bitcoin or other digital coins.

## Highlights

- Google will let some customers pay for cloud services with cryptocurrencies early in 2023.
- The deal might succeed in luring cutting-edge companies to Google in a fierce, fast-growing market.
- Google Cloud Platform will initially accept cryptocurrency payments from a handful of customers in the Web3 world who want to pay with cryptocurrency.
- The cloud business helps diversify Google parent Alphabet away from advertising, and it now accounts for 9% of revenue, up from less than 6% three years ago.
- Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Etherum, Litecoin and Litecoin prices have all declined over 60% in the past year, but prices have declined.
