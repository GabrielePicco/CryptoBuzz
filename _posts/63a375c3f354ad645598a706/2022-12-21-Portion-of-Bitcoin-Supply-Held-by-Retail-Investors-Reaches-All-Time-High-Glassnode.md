Retail investors are accumulating more and more Bitcoin, according to blockchain data from Glassnode, setting a new peak.

## Highlights

- 17% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply is now held by retail investors, according to new data from analytics firm, Glassnode.
- Glassnode defines "retail" as holding less than 10 BTC in a wallet, currently worth nearly $169,000.
- Retail investors are accumulating more and more Bitcoin, setting a new peak, data from Glassnode shows.
- Bitcoin also appears to have a more even distribution distribution across various percentiles than other top cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin and DOGE, including Ethereum and Dogecoins, than those with large addresses with at least 0.1% of the total supply, compared to just 9% of all Bitcoin.
