Bitcoin is highly regarded for the fact that it hasn’t been hacked once in the more than 12 years since the genesis block on the Bitcoin network was mined. For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin stored on the network is safe as long as you protect the private key that secures your Bitcoin wallet.

## Highlights

- The FBI seized around sixty-four Bitcoin allegedly included as part of the payment made to a hacker group in connection with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021.
- The FBI has the ‘private key’ or the rough equivalent of a password needed to access assets accessible from the specific Bitcoin address.
- The idea that the FBI could infiltrate the Bitcoin network was laughable from the start, and seems to have been proven wrong by the FBI’s own press release.
- Every Bitcoin wallet consists of two things: a public key and a private key.
- A private key is significantly more secure than a common password because it is a randomly generated sequence of characters that is not stored anywhere except for the spot you choose to secure it.
