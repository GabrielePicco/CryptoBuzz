The brother of a former Coinbase Global Inc product manager pleaded guilty on Monday to a wire fraud conspiracy charge, in what U.S. prosecutors have called the first insider trading case involving cryptocurrency.

## Highlights

- The brother of a former Coinbase Global Inc product manager pleaded guilty on Monday to a wire fraud conspiracy charge.
- Nikhil Wahi, 26, admitted during a virtual court hearing before U.S.
- District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan.
- Prosecutors say Ishan Wahi shared confidential information with his brother and their friend about new digital assets Coinbase was planning to let users trade.
- The pair then allegedly used ethereum blockchain wallets to acquire the assets and traded at least 14 times before announcements in June 2021 and April 2022.
- Those announcements typically caused the assets to rise in value and generated at least $1.5 million in gains, prosecutors said.
