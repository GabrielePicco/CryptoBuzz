## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin says stablecoin's need a back-to-basics approach for future success.
- He touted "principles-based thinking" in a blog post entitled "Two Thought Experiments to Evaluate Automates Stablecoins" The remarks come after the crash of Terra, the algorithmic stablecoin used code and relied on the minting and burning of a sister-token to maintain a peg to the dollar.
- Butterin also cautioned that expecting the broader cryptocurrency market to continue to notch limitless growth is detrimental to the market's future.
- "The crypto space needs to move away from the attitude that it's okay to achieve safety by relying on endless growth,"
