In spite of allegations of workplace polyamory, it appears that FTX's in-house psychiatrist didn't think the people involved we having enough sex.

## Highlights

- Psychiatrist George K. Lerner said he'd known Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, for years before he took up a post as the firm's company "coach" For his part, he denies the claim that the CEO or anyone else in the company's orbit in the Bahamas was getting up to anything all that freaky.
- "The higher-ups, they mostly played chess and board games.
- They were undersexed, if anything," Lerner told the New York Times.
- Lerner is still using an FTX email address, and he's spent most of the last week "hand-holding" employees and "making sure that people get safely back home"
