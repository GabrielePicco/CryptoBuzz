Decentralized and efficient governance are the main goals of the new model.

## Highlights

- Polkadot and Kusama founder Gavin Wood announced that the blockchain's governance model would undergo a new transformation.
- Dubbed Gov2, anyone would be able to start a referendum at any time for as many times as they wish in the new setup, similar to initiating new transactions on the blockchain.
- Thereafter, pending referenda need 50% of the vote from stakeholders within 28 days' time for approval or face rejection by default.
- Gov2 is set to launch on Kusama imminently, following afinal professional audit of its code.
- Once tested, a proposal will be made to bridge it to PolkadOT, Wood said.
