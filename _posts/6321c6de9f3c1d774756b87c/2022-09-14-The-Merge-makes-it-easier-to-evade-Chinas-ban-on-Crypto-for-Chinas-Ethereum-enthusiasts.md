The much-anticipated network update on Ethereum could provide a new way for China's crypto enthusiasts to participate in the blockchain economy.

## Highlights

- 'The Merge' could be good news for China’s cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
- Staking offers a more censorship-resistant way for people to participate in the crypto economy.
- China banned cryptocurrency mining and trading two years ago.
- The country accounted for as much as two-thirds of Bitcoin's worldwide hash power, the energy consumed to carry out proof-of-work.
- But after the Merge, the amount of energy it takes to validate transactions will be “indistinguishable” from that method, said Daniel Dizon, co-founder and CEO of Swell Network, an Ethereum staking protocol.
- The transition will also make it harder for regulators to trace participants in the network.
