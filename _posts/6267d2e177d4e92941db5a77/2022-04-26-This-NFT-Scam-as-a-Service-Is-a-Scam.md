How an NFT wallet drain scam led us to discover the seller of a Scam as a Service product, which they likely use to scam their own clients.

## Highlights

- A Doodles NFT scam was created by a seller who sold their code for $29.99 â€“ $149.00.
- The product had good reviews and a 4.8 star rating.
- We set out to investigate their scheme and find out whether their star rating was justified.
- The scam site makes the victims connect their wallets to the scam site.
- It uses the Opensea API to check what type of NFTs the victim has in their wallet.
- The victim is tricked into believing that paying the transaction gas fees will provide some precious NFT.
