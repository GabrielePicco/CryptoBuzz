Increasing the regulatory powers of the Fed could sound the death knell for private stablecoins.

## Highlights

- Federal Reserve employees at the Fed have proposed policy recommendations that threaten to wipe out privately issued stablecoins.
- One proposal is to “introduce a central bank digital currency and tax private money out of existence” The Fed also wants control over nonbank stablecoin issuers and money market funds.
- Bryan Bashur: Increasing the regulatory powers of the Fed could sound the death knell for private stablecoins, but Congress needs to act first to stop the Fed from expanding its regulatory authority over stablecoin.
- Bashur is a federal affairs manager at Shareholder Advocacy Forum and director of the Shareholder Americans for Tax Reform and executive of the Tax Reform.
