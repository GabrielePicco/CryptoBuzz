The project had been behind schedule for 11 months.

## Highlights

- Ardana halted development on decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin ecosystem building on Cardano (ADA) The move came as a shock to many due to the sudden nature of the announcement.
- The project will remain open-source for builders while treasury balances and remaining funds will be held by Ardana Labs.
- Ardana has held an ongoing initial stake pool offering, or ISPO, to fund its operations.
- Over the past year, Ardana's native DANA tokens have lost close to 99.85% of their value.
- Most users reacted negatively, placing the blame on Ardana instead of Cardano, blaming the project for the delay.
