An indie dev has made a game inspired by Logan Paul's controversial CryptoZoo—without the crypto. Could a Web3 version be made just as fast?

## Highlights

- Indie game developer Yipy has released a game inspired by Logan Paul's CryptoZoo game.
- RealZoo allows users to login using a Gmail account and are immediately granted tokens for free to spend on eggs, which hatch into animals.
- But those tokens aren't on any blockchain, and can’t be cashed out for any real value.
- Paul has struggled to deliver on the game since the spring of 2021.
- An ex-CryptoZoo engineer says he is owed $1 million for his work on the project, but Paul disputes these claims and plans to sue the YouTuber for defamation.
- An industry veteran says a Web3 game could have been made in the same timeframe with crypto elements.
