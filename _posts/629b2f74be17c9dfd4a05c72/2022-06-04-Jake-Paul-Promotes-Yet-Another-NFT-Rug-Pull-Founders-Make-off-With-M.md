Another NFT project promoted by Jake Paul has failed to deliver on its promises and rug pulled its community, this time to the tune of $6.3 million.

## Highlights

- Another NFT project promoted by Jake Paul has failed to deliver on its promises and rug pulled its community.
- Animoon marketed itself as a play-to-earn game featuring 9,999 programmatically generated Animoon NFTs.
- The project even went on to assert that they had signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Pok√©mon themselves.
- The founders of Animoon, named Mounir Mokaddem and Singainy Marc Oceane, appear to have a considerable resume of criminal enterprises to their names.
- Jake Paul is gathering an unenviable reputation in the crypto sphere as a celebrity shill for hire, promoting projects whether good or bad.
