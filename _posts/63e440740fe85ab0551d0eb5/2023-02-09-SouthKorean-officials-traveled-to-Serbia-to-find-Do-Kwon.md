South Korean prosecutors have intensified their efforts to find Do Kwon and reportedly sent state officials to find him in Serbia.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon has been accused of being on the run since Sept.
- 14, when South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant against him.
- The 31-year-old founder of the now-collapsed Terra ecosystem has denied any wrongdoing.
- South Korea has stripped Kwon of his passport, which may make future travel more difficult.
- Kwon recently responded to an evocative tweet targeted at him, stating that he hasn’t stolen any money and has never had any “secret cashouts” The Terra ecosystem was in part triggered by the de-peg of its TerraClassicUSD stablecoin, UST, which too fell close to 100%.
