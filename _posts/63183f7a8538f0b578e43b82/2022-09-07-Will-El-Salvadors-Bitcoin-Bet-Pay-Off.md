The country has gone long on Bitcoin adoption as it attempts to overcome the monetary reigns of the IMF and United States.

## Highlights

- Kudzai Kutukwa is a financial inclusion advocate who was recognized by Fast Company magazine as one of South Africa’s top-20 young entrepreneurs under 30.
- He says El Salvador is the first country in the world to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in the country.
- The U.S.
- government has the power to veto all major decisions made by the organization and the voting power of any nation on any major decision to adopt Bitcoin is the threat to the “rules-based” global financial system, he writes.
- The IMF wields a tremendous amount of power over the global economy.
- Kutukw: The IMF is the enforcers of the hegemony of the dollar and the enforcer of financial stability, financial integrity and consumer protection.
