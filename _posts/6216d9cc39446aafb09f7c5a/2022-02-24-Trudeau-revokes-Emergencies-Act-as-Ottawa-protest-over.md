Ontario’s state of emergency is also being revoked to align with the federal government

## Highlights

- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the government can revoke the Emergencies Act now that the crisis in Ottawa and at Canada’s border crossings has calmed down.
- Trudeau invoked the act for the first time last week, saying police needed extra help to end protests against COVID-19 restrictions that had occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks and spread to key Canada-U.S.
- border crossings.
- Ontario's state of emergency is also being revoked to align with the federal government.
- An inquiry into the circumstances that led up the crisis led up to the emergency legislation, which is a requirement under the act, will take within 60 days, Trudeau says.
- The Senate began debating a motion on the act Tuesday, but adjourned the discussion Wednesday.
