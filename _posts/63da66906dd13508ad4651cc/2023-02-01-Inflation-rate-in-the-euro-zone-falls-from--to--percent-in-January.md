Inflation in the euro zone dropped for a third consecutive month in January.

## Highlights

- Inflation in the euro zone eased in the last two months of 2022 but the economic indicator is still well-above the 2% mandate of the European Central Bank.
- Energy charges fell to an estimated 17.2% in January, down from 25.5% in December.
- The 20-member region has gone through substantial price increases in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed up energy and food costs across the bloc.
- Core inflation, which strips out energy costs, stood at a record 5.2%, so the ECB will remain very hawkish, says Capital Economics economist Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.
