Ethereum - the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap - has been experiencing a significant rise in network activity.

## Highlights

- EIP-1559 upgrade has made ETH a deflationary asset, decreasing its overall supply.
- This has caused a decrease in the overall supply of ETH this year, as tracked by Ultrasound.Money.com.
- The network is now preparing for the Shanghai upgrade, another significant upgrade that is expected to occur next month.
- New features such as sharding and zero-knowledge proofs will enhance the networkâ€™s scalability by allowing the network to perform parallel processing.
- This feature will improve the speed and efficiency of transactions.
- The Shanghai upgrade will release $25 billion worth of ETH that has been locked in early staking contracts.
