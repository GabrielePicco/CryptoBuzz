Founder and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will not contest extradition to the U.S. in an about face just days after being remanded to Bahamas prison.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will not contest extradition to the U.S.
- in an about-face just days after he was remanded to Bahamas jail pending a hearing.
- The 30-year-old MIT graduate was indicted in New York federal court on Monday, on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and money laundering.
- If sentenced, he could face the rest of his life in prison.
- FTX's collapse was precipitated when reporting by CoinDesk revealed a highly concentrated position in self-issued FTT coins, which he used as collateral for billions in crypto loans, had been lost along the way.
