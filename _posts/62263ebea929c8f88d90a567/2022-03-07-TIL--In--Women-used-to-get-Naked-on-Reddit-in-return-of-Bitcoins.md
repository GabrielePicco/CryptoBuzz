The future of sexuality is here, and boy it's predictably sad and weird: girls stripping for Bitcoin tips, a virtual currency that's not really worth anything. Start mining yer coins, boys! Welcome to GirlsGoneBitcoin.

## Highlights

- GirlsGoneBitcoin lets you see naked photos of themselves taking Bitcoin tips.
- The concept is simple: girls (or guys, occasionally!)
- upload photos.
- Their Bitcoin addresses are posted alongside, allowing you to donate internet funny money to get to the money shot.
- Nevermind that Reddit already provides a massive repository of porn pics that don't require a byzantine "tipping" systemâ€”this is all about power.
- At least this gives Bitcoin enthusiasts something more to do with their reserves than buy guns and heroin.
