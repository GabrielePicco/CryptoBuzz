Ubisoft keeps enlisting crypto allies as it now turns to The HBAR Foundation and explores the Hedera ecosystem.

## Highlights

- Video game publisher Ubisoft has agreed to enter the Hedera ecosystem.
- The firm will join the Governing Council and run a node in the network.
- Ubisoft will also implement a HederA track into its Entrepreneurs Lab program.
- The publisher became a Tezos network validator in April 2021.
- Ubisoft recently announced its in-game items for Tom Clancyâ€™s Ghost Recon Breakpoint as Tezos-based NFTs.
- An NFT acts like a deed of ownership to a digital item, whether it's artwork, video files, or an interactive object within a video game.
