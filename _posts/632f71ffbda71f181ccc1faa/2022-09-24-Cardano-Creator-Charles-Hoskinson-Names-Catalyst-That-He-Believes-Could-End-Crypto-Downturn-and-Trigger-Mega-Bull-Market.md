The creator of Ethereum (ETH) challenger Cardano (ADA) says that he’s identified the catalyst that would end the crypto winter and spark a massive industry-wide rally.

## Highlights

- Charles Hoskinson, creator of the smart contract platform, says that if the US government were to pass the Financial Innovation Act, the crypto markets would begin a mega bull run.
- Hoskinson says that the passing of this act would prompt blue-chip investors to flood the markets with capital as well as reduce the regulatory risks associated with investing in digital assets.
- The act was proposed by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York in June.
- However, Hoskinson notes that it’s possible for the markets to go the other way if certain regulators, such as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, are further empowered.
