European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says she is convinced of the need to move ahead with a digital euro in a conversation with pranksters impersonating Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, and admitted that a CBDC would mean control over money.

## Highlights

- A widely shared video of European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde admitting that a digital euro will be used in a “limited” way to control the payments that people can make was taken from a three-week-old prank video.
- The video was highlighted by the breaking news account Watcher Guru on April 6 and generated a significant amount of social media chatter.
- In it, Lagarde cited a desire to not be reliant on an “unfriendly countries currency,” or a currency provided by a ‘private corporate entity like Facebook or like Google’ She said she is “personally convinced that we have to move ahead” with the digital euro.
