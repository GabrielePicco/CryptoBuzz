The crypto market is in shambles once again, with bitcoin, ether, and many altcoins dumping to yearly lows.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin dumped below the coveted $20,000 line to a new multi-year low.
- The altcoins are deep in the red as well, with ETH slumping below $1,000 for the first time in over a year.
- Bitcoin's market cap is down to $360 billion, and its dominance has been reduced to just over 43%.
- The premium on Grayscaleâ€™s Bitcoin Trust has gone deep into negative territory with an all-time low of -34%.
- Despite all of the bearish sentiment in the crypto markets, Adam Back is still bullish on the asset and believes it will tap $100K by the end of the year.
