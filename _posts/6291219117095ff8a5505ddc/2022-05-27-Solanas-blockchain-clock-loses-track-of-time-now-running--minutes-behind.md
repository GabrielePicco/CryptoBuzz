The Solana network clock has lost its sync with real-world time and is now running about half an hour behind.

## Highlights

- Solana's (SOL) blockchain clock is adrift of real-world time by about 30 minutes due to longer than ideal slot times.
- Slower slot times on the Solana network mean fewer epochs for staking rewards.
- Transactions on the network will, however, show timestamps that are different from “wall-clock time” Solana’s ideal slot time is 400 milliseconds but this value has doubled to about 746ms.
- The issue does not have any impact on network performance, according to a status page posted at 3:34 UTC.
- The network has suffered outages on different occasions with the blockchain not processing transactions for several hours at a time.
