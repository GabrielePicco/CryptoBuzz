Solana (SOL) is recording significant capital outflow, with the network facing various challenges, including hacks and system outages.

## Highlights

- Decentralized finance asset Solana (SOL) is recording significant capital outflow, with the network facing various challenges, including hacks and system outages.
- The incidents appear to limit Solanaâ€™s potential to take over established platforms like ETH.
- As of October 13, Solana had a market cap of $10.6 billion, representing a drop of over $1.43 billion or 13% from the $12.08 billion recorded on October 6.
- The latest drop comes after Solana-based DeFi exchange Mango Markets was hit with an exploit of $100 million.
- It is worth noting that this is the second hack related to Solana in barely two months.
