To select the weighting of each ETF, Tuttle Capital Management will essentially take the opposite position of whatever Cramer publicly picks on CNBC or Twitter.

## Highlights

- Connecticut-based advisory firm Tuttle Capital Management has submitted a preliminary prospectus filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
- If approved, if approved, the firm would launch a short ETF named Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) and a long ETF called Long Cramer.
- The investment objective is to provide investment results “that are approximately the opposite of, before fees and expenses, the results of the investments recommended by television personality Jim Cramer’s investments,” the filing reads.
- The firm previously caused a stir late last year by launching an inverse ETF on the Nasdaq stock exchange called the Turtle Capital Short Innovation ETF.
