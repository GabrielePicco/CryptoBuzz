Elevated demand for Bitcoin across its $40K, $30K, and $20K support levels has created a new cohort of short-term holders that are more confident about Bitcoin.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) has retreated 3.1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $21,146 at the time of writing.
- Glassnode’s UkuriaOC pointed to “extreme demand” around the $20,000 region.
- Each psychological price level from $40,000 to $30,000 creates a new group of short-term holders (STHs) Glassnode analyst noted that much of the supply that new STHs bought during that drawdown has not been sold even though prices are significantly down.
- This may be due to less price-sensitive buyers or those who care more about Bitcoin fundamentals than investment gains.
