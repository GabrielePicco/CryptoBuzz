Dogecoin founder Billy Markus apparently doesn't think very highly of the people who invest in cryptocurrencies like his.

## Highlights

- Billy Markus appears to be responding to the crash of the Terra stablecoin last week.
- Markus said it appears that large swaths of crypto investors “don’t even understand the fundamental basics of either crypto or how markets work” Markus added some advice to his griping, suggesting that crypto investors do their own research and make decisions using “common sense” The 39-year-0ld Dogecoin founder suggested that “Have a plan,” he added, “Don't invest emotionally.” It’s pretty good advice, but it also seems a bit hypocritical, since its creator got rich only after Elon Musk plugged their joke coin via memes.
