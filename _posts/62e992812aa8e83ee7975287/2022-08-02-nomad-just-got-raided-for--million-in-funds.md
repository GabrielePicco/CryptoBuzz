Another token bridge appears to have been exploited for nearly $200 million. The Nomad team says it is aware and is currently investigating the incident.

## Highlights

- Nomad token bridge appears to have experienced a security exploit that has allowed hackers to systematically drain a significant portion of the bridge’s funds over a long series of transactions.
- Nearly the entire $190.7 million in crypto has been removed from the bridge, with only $651.54 left remaining in the wallet.
- Nomad later suggested to Cointelegraph that some of the funds were withdrawn by “white hat friends” who took the funds out with the intention of safeguarding them.
- The team added that it had retained the services of “leading firms for blockchain intelligence and forensics:” The Moonbeam smart contract platform from the Polkadot network went into maintenance mode at 11:18 pm UTC “to investigate a security incident”
