The worst of the deleveraging has passed, but crypto could face sideways trading, says Galaxy Digital's Mike Novogratz.

## Highlights

- Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says the worst of the deleveraging has passed.
- He says it feels like we're 90% through that deleverage, but crypto could face sideways trading.
- "My instinct is it's going to be choppy sideways for a while until either the Fed flinches and we get that macro narrative, or the damage is healed and people get liberated when the market starts going again," he said.
- "There will be gross misconduct in some of these companies when you just look at the amount of both leverage and inter-lending that went on," he added.
- "When all is said and done, there will be accusations and prosecutions for fraud"
