As crypto becomes more widespread, financial firms have taken steps to pave way for the implementation of digital assets.

## Highlights

- SWIFT aims to bring together the brightest minds to solve the problem.
- The event will be a continuation of its objective to address the most difficult problems that arise in the development of the digital currency.
- The idea is to examine whether the transferring from one currency to another will lead to an even higher level of complexity, or whether it needs to be more complex, in order to solve these problems.
- SWIFT is looking to speed up processes and find a way to solve this problem by developing a new way of dealing with the problem in the future of the system.
- The project is called ‘SwiftCoin’ and aims to work together with the world’s leading banks and government agencies.
