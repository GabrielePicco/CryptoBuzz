Cardano Founder and XRP Community Enter Contentious Argument

## Highlights

- Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, slips into a contentious argument with the (XRP) community over its protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
- Hoskinson calls their argument about the SEC a grand conspiracy, in a podcast on Friday.
- He believes the entire XRP affair shouldnâ€™t have happened because it is terrible for the industry and that regulation through enforcement is equally harmful.
- He also blamed the legislative arm of the government for gross negligence in passing new laws to resolve the consequences of new technology.
- The Cardano founder registered displeasure about how the crypto community reacted to his statement in a 16-part Twitter thread early today.
