It was supposed to be a move to a new cold storage address, but was sent to a whitelisted external exchange address. We worked with Gate team and the funds were subsequently returned to cold storage. New process and features were implemented

## Highlights

- It was supposed to be a move to a new cold storage address, but was sent to a whitelisted external exchange address.
- We worked with Gate team and the funds were subsequently returned to cold storage.
- New process and features were implemented to prevent this from reoccurring.
- The funds were then returned to their cold storage, we said, and we are working with Gate to prevent it from happening again.
