Saylor has become a leader in the crypto community ever since his company began adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, but being a crypto evangelist comes with some serious risks.

## Highlights

- MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor is one of the most fervent Bitcoin supporters on the planet.
- Saylor's company added another $215 million worth of Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $44,645 per coin in the first quarter.
- The companyâ€™s stock is down over 20% in the past month and nearly 65% from its February 2021 all-time high of over $1,000 per share.
- But Saylor and company could face one hell of a margin call if Bitcoin's price falls below $21,000, or around 50% from current levels, if it needs to buy more Bitcoin to back its $205 million Bitcoin-collateralized loan.
