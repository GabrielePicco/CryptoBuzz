Algorand is a complex yet beginner friendly blockchain that seeks to solve the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security. It has lightning fast transaction times, micro-cent fees, a…

## Highlights

- Algorand is a complex yet beginner friendly blockchain that seeks to solve the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security.
- There are over 1,300 nodes being run right now, but this could be improved by increasing this number in the future via incentivization.
- The goal of this article is to educate reader’s about the network weaknesses by explaining and breaking down the problem.
- We will discuss the current state of the network structure and explain how it is centralized and why that is bad.
- We also discuss current propositions to change it and how we can move forward.
- The real issue lies with Relay Nodes, which are the network hubs and link to each other.
