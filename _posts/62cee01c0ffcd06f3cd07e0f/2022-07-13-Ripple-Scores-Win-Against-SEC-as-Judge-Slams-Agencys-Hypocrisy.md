- Legal experts have dubbed the decision a "body slam" and a "significant tactical win" in its defense against the SEC.
- The development has been described as a “body slam” for Ripple.
- The SEC sued Ripple Labs Inc.
- and two of its executives, Brad Glaringhouse and Christian Larsen, alleging that the firm raised over $1.3 billion through “an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering” However, throughout its defense, Ripple has argued that its utility coin, XRP, is not a security.
