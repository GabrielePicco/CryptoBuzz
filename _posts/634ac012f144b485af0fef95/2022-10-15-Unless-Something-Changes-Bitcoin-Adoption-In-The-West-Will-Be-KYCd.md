Currently, Western bitcoin adoption is largely dominated by centralized, KYC and AML compliant exchanges.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin adoption in the West is going to take a fundamentally different path than the path other parts of the world will take.
- The West has the rule of law, regulated markets, a population that has access to bank accounts and a currency that doesn't debase as rapidly as other currencies.
- The idea that we are free is folly.
- Bitcoin is our best hope to change our current circumstances, but it starts with people purchasing and owning Bitcoin.
- The next wave of people coming into the next wave will be the mom-and-pop shop owners down the street, your truck driver.
- We've dealt with this problem in the world; we'll target this problem with the world.
