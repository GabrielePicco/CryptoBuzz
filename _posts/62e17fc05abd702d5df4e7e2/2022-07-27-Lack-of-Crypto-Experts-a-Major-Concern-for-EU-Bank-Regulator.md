The European Union’s banking regulator admitted it is facing the lack of talent required to enforce new rules regulating the crypto industry.

## Highlights

- European Banking Authority is worried about its ability to enforce new rules regulating the $1 trillion crypto industry.
- The EU finalized its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislative package in March this year.
- It seeks to achieve legal certainty for the crypto industry while ensuring financial stability across all 27 member nations.
- EBA chair José Manuel Campa says it will only be until 2025 when the agency will know exactly which cryptocurrencies it will be charged with supervising when new rules come into force.
- He said the agency's biggest challenge is hiring and retaining the specialized personnel needed to supervise the industry.
- Campa didn't rule out that EBA may get it wrong with the fast-evolving crypto sector.
