Crypto accounting, yet again, is on the minds of investors and regulators alike

## Highlights

- Recent developments have reinforced the need and importance of cryptoasset audits.
- FASB has agreed to move certain aspects of crypto-asset reporting onto its research agenda.
- Audit is a report on whether or not the financial data being reported is done so in compliance with the appropriate accounting standards and rules.
- The specifics of any audit engagement will need to vary from instrument to instrument.
- Audit processes might be more interested in determining appropriate valuation methodologies for cryptoassets in reserve, and reporting these assets on balance sheet.
- No asset class can go from the fringe of the internet to a multi-trillion dollar valuation along the way without some improvements, says Marcin O'Brien.
