Thevamanogari Manivel and her husband Jatinder Singh faced the Victoria Supreme Court this week, pleading not guilty to charges related to spending $10.5 million Crypto.com accidentally sent them.

## Highlights

- Thevamanogari Manivel and her husband, Jatinder Singh, have pleaded not guilty to charges related to spending $10.5 million on Crypto.com's funds.
- The pair are arguing that they thought the funds were won via a competition.
- The firm did not realize its mistake until an audit occurred in December.
- The funds were allegedly used to buy four houses, vehicles, gifts for relatives, art and some furniture.
- One of their four houses included a 1.35 million AUD five bedroom property in Craigieburn, which the court promptly ordered to be sold and the money returned to the site.
- The couple are set for a directions hearing in the county court on Nov.
