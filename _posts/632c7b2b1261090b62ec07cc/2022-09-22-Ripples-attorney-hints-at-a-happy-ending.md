XRP price has been consolidating for quite some time and has dug below crucial support levels but has recovered above it equally quickly. The last leg

## Highlights

- Ripple price has been consolidating for quite some time and has dug below crucial support levels but has recovered above it equally quickly.
- XRP price has taken off after the last retest of the triple tap setup, rallying roughly 31% in about a week.
- Ripple’s general counsel has stated they feel ‘confident’ and could be the start of the end for this lawsuit that has been ongoing since December 2020.
- A breakdown of the $0.384 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis and skew the odds in bears’ favor.
- The last leg of Ripple has been an amazing sight to behold as it exploded swiftly and through many long-standing hurdles.
