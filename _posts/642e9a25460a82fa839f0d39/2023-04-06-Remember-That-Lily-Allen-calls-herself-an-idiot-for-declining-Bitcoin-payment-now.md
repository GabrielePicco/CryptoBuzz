The singer refused an offer to play an online gig for the virtual currency

## Highlights

- Singer turned down offer to perform on virtual currency in Second Life.
- Single Bitcoin is currently valued at $974 (£593) making “hundreds of thousands” a huge fee to have rejected.
- Allen’s fortune could be worth more than 20 times her £6m reported worth had she accepted the offer.
- IT worker James Howells had 7,500 Bitcoins in early 2009 when currency was launched publicly, but stored them on a laptop hard drive that he later threw away by mistake.
- One Bitcoin started at $13.30 (£8) in January and rose dramatically to hit $1,127.45 (£687) in December.
