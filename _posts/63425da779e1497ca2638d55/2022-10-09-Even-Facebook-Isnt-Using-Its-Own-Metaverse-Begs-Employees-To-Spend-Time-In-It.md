The VR project needs some internal love, according to leaked memos

## Highlights

- A report from The Verge says Meta's Horizon Worlds VR app is riddled with bugs and papercuts.
- The Verge has seen internal memos from within the company's VR headset.
- They say the app is so badly bad, even the creators themselves don’t want to use it.
- It comes in the wake of last month’s hilarious multi-clown car pile-up when Mark Zuckerberg tweeted out the colossally awful avatar graphics Horizon was to sport.
- The company has only promised to raise a funding round untbled by untundbled by a round untweaked by a new round of money.
- It is a brutal reality that Meta is apparently attempting to fight with the power of power.
