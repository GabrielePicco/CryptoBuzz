Hardware wallet provider Trezor reported a 900% week-on-week growth in its sales volume, according to May 25 press statement shared with CryptoSlate.

## Highlights

- Hardware wallet provider Trezor reported a 900% week-on-week growth in its sales volume.
- Surge comes in the wake of Ledger’s seed recovery feature that drew stiff opposition from the crypto community.
- The company said it is a fully open-source company, meaning some independent technical experts audit and check all of its processes so that a remote seed phrase extraction is impossible or ever implemented.
- According to the CEO Matěj Žák, “We believe that hardware wallets – cold storages that promise 100% self-custody should, at no stage, make the seed phrase accessible to anyone but the user”
