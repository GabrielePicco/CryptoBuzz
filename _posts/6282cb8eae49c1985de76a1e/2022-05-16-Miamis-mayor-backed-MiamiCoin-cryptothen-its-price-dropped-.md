MiamiCoin has generated money for Miami but lost 95% of its value in the process

## Highlights

- Miami cashed out its cryptocurrency MiamiCoin for the first time, depositing $5.25 million into city coffers.
- The city of Miami received millions of dollars through its agreement with CityCoins.
- MiamiCoin has lost nearly all of its value, falling about 95% from its September peak to just $0.0032 as of May 13.
- Miami's mayor Francis Suarez hailed it as a “historic moment” and predicted the cryptocurrency could one day replace municipal taxes as the government’s primary source of funding.
- Suarez, a rising Republican star with national electoral ambitions, has made it clear he believes MiamiCoin can burnish his own image as a pro-tech politician.
