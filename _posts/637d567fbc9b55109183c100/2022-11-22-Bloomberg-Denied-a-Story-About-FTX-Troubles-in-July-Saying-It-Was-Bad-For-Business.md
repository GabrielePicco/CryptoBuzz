Five Bloomberg journalists were presented with a story about all the mess at FTX back in July, but they denied it saying \"it was bad for business.\"

## Highlights

- Five Bloomberg journalists were presented with a story about all the mess at FTX back in July, but they denied it saying “it was bad for business” Short seller Marc Cohodes said he presented a story to Bloomberg crypto team four months before the platform’s meltdown.
- Cohodes was one of the few skeptics that didn’t buy the story of how a 30-year-old guy who had not spent any serious time at a major Wall Street institution could make millions by buying Bitcoin in the US and selling it in Japan.
- A video of Cohodes declaring, about a month before FTX blew up, that Bankman-Fried was likely “dirty and rotten to core” has been making the rounds on Twitter as proof.
