The framework outlines ways in which the financial services industry should evolve to make borderless transactions easier, as well as how to crack down on fraud.

## Highlights

- The Biden White House has released its first-ever framework on what crypto regulation in the U.S.
- should look like.
- The new directives tap the muscle of existing regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
- The long-awaited direction from Washington has captured the attention of both the crypto industry as a whole â€” and of investors in this nascent asset class.
- More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the Federal Trade Commission.
- A new kind of digital dollar, or CBDC, would be a "fully regulated, fully regulated" digital currency.
