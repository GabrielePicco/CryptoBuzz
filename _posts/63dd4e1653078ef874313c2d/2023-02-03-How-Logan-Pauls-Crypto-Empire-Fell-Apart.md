Logan Paul has convinced his fans to invest millions in several crypto projects, including CryptoZoo and Liquid Marketplace. Many have lost money.

## Highlights

- YouTuber Logan Paul's CryptoZoo game, a game in which you could hatch and breed hybrid NFT animals that would gain in value over time, has gone awry.
- The value of the game has plummeted to less than a hundredth of its August 2021 peak.
- Paul told TIME in April 2022 that his involvement with the project was “super minimal” Paul pledged to relinquish his stake in the game, refund holders at least $1.3 million, and finish the game.
- Paul's legal representative: “Bad actors hijacked the project at Logan’s expense, and we are confident any claims of fraud will be discredited throughout this process”
