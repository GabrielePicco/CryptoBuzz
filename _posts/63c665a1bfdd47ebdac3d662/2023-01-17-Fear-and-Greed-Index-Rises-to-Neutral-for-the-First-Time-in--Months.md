The Index stopped at 52 yesterday (January 15), which was its highest point in the last nine months.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is a metric that determines the community’s general sentiment on the primary cryptocurrency.
- It was either in the “Fear” or “Extreme Fear” zones during the past nine months, prompted by the prolonged bear market and adverse events that surrounded the cryptocurrency industry.
- The Index pointed at 52 yesterday (January 15), meaning it was in “Neutral” territory for the first time since April 5, 2022.
- Despite the recent surge, the Index has now returned to the state of ‘Fear,” dropping to 45 (which was its highest point in the last nine months)
