CZ details his personal and business history with China, and why it's wrong to label Binance as Chinese-controlled.

## Highlights

- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) released a statement on Binance blog to demystify the company’s relationship with China.
- He and his family fled from China when he was 12 years old, only two months after the events of June 4th 1989.
- CZ moved back to China in 2005, and started an exchange-as-a-service business called Bijie Tech in 2015.
- However, the Chinese government shut down all of such exchanges in March 2017, forcing the business to end.
- It then imposed a similar unilateral ban on crypto exchanges operating in China on September 4th – just a month and a half after CZ and his team started Binance.
