## Highlights

- Do Kwon, who is wanted by prosecutors and the subject of a class action lawsuit by more than 300 investors from Singapore, is reportedly seeking refuge in Europe.
- KBS said it is “understood that Kwon is in Europe” after he left the third country he fled to during his attempts to elude authorities following the collapse of Terra Labs.
- Authorities have “partially identified’s current location as they have found evidence that the Terra co-founder is currently in Europe as an illegal immigrant.
- Authorities now have an idea as to his current general location – as long as his exact position can’t be pinpointed – but he will still remain one step ahead of his pursuers.
