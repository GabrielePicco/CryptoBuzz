The crypto market’s slide has continued, with Bitcoin and Ethereum recording new 52-week lows every day this week.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin has lost a third of its market cap over the past week.
- The leading cryptocurrency by market cap slipped to a new 52-week low of $20,184.
- The primary reasons behind today’s bearish action are the upcoming federal rate hike to control inflation, increased crypto fund outflows and reduced decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.
- The Total Value Locked (TVL), across all blockchains including Tron, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Solana has fallen by over 8% in the past 24 hours, according to data from DefiLlama.
- With inflation rates peaking at 8.6%, the Fed is expected to make an announcement regarding a possible rate hike today.
