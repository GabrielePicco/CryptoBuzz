Garlinghouse believes countries like Australia, Japan, and Singapore have done the right thing by establishing clear crypto rules.

## Highlights

- Brad Garlinghouse – Chief Executive Officer of Ripple – thinks the US is already lagging behind other nations in crypto because of regulatory uncertainty.
- He compared the potential of the technology’s potential to the Internet, highlighting the decision to embrace it in the 1990s.
- Australia, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and Switzerland have already imposed comprehensive rules on the cryptocurrency sector and thus encouraged investors and entrepreneurs to operate on their soil.
- He advised the American government, specifically the SEC, to do the same and cease the talent exodus offshore.
- The SEC-Ripple Case will be “pivotal” for the entire sector, Garlinghre says.
