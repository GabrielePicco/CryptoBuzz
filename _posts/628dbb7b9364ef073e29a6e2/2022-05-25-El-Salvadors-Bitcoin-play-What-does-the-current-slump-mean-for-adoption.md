With talk of Bitcoin’s volatility taking center stage in recent weeks, El Salvador’s losses may dissuade other countries from adopting crypto as legal tender.

## Highlights

- El Salvador bought 200 Bitcoin in September 2021, worth about $10.3 million at the time.
- The Central American nation now has 2,301 BTC, which are estimated to be worth a little over $67 million at current prices.
- The value of the country’s BTC haul has dropped 45% since September 2021.
- At press time, El Salvador owes bondholders a cumulative total of $382 million in interest, which is to be paid out by the end of this year.
- The country has been trying to lock in a $1.3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, an effort that seems to have lost steam following the country's fierce BTC adoption drive.
