title:  "Cardano Is Launching New Privacy Blockchain and Token"
description: "Input Output Global (IOG), the firm behind the Cardano blockchain, is releasing a new privacy-focused blockchain called Midnight and a token called dust to accompany the new network.  Midnight, which is underpinned by zero-knowledge-proof technology, is one of many side chains now being deployed around Cardano, and will go beyond previous privacy-coin projects by delivering zero-knowledge-proof smart contracts, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson said during an event at Edinburgh University in Scotland on Friday.  “Midnight has evolved privacy-coin technology where everything was anonymous by default, which is what Zcash and Monero did with Snarks and ring signatures,” Hoskinson said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to two other privacy coins and their encryption methods."

## Highlights

- IOG, the firm behind the Cardano blockchain, is releasing a new privacy-focused blockchain called Midnight and a token called dust to accompany the new network.
- Midnight, which is underpinned by zero-knowledge-proof technology, is one of many side chains now being deployed around Cardano.
- The system will walk the line between preserving privacy and allowing regulators and auditors a backdoor into the system when permission is granted, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson said.
- Midnight will be working with Hyperledger, a consortium of large firms exploring private and permissioned ledgers for things like supply-chain management, he added.
- Privacy coins have always been lionized by crypto libertarians, but have been viewed warily by regulators
