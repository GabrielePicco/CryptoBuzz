Samsung will launch its cryptocurrency exchange platform in 2023. Large South Korean firms will establish cryptocurrency exchange platforms.

## Highlights

- Samsung is in the process of designing its crypto exchange platform in South Korea.
- It would be launched in the first half of 2023.
- Samsung could also develop its own cryptocurrency.
- New South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol has encouraged companies and individuals to invest in cryptocurrencies.
- Large South Korean firms will establish cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the next half of next year.
- It's also a good time for Samsung to launch a crypto exchange since the former South Korean administration shut down dozens of platforms in 2021 through a regulatory law, which drastically increased the requirements and obligations necessary to open such a service in the country.
