SBF once again expressed concern that potential pathways for recovery may have been abandoned due to the Chapter 11 filing.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried has largely denied the allegations against him in a “pre-mortem overview” of FTX’s insolvency.
- FTX US had been “fully solvent” at the time the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, he said.
- FTx International had roughly $8 billion in assets when John Ray took over as CEO, he added.
- He blamed the collapse of the crypto market crash of 2022 and a ‘months-long PR campaign’ by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for FTX's bankruptcy.
- The former CEO has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges in his case, including violations of campaign finance laws and wire fraud.
