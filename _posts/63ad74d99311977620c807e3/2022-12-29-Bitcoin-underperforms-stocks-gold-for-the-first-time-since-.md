Bitcoin’s 2022 losses come closer to those recorded by the stocks of high-profile companies like Tesla and Meta.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price looks poised to close 2022 down nearly 70% — its worst year since the crypto crash of 2018.
- Bitcoin's depressive performance can be explained by factors such as the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to curb rising inflationary pressures.
- Gold and stocks have underperformed in 2022, but the year has been difficult for Bitcoin investors, in particular.
- The U.S.
- benchmark S&P 500 has plunged nearly 20% YTD to 3,813 points as of Dec.
- 28.
