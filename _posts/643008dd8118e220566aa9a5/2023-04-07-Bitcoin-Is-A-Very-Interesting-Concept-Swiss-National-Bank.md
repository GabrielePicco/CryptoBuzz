The Vice President of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) Martin Schlegel has caused a stir in the Bitcoin community. Here's why.

## Highlights

- The Vice President of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) Martin Schlegel has caused a stir in the Bitcoin community with a new remark in a TV interview.
- The statement implies that the SNB is curious about the technology and the potential use of Bitcoin.
- However, it does not mean that it supports or opposes BTC.
- This is notable because a US Federal Reserve (Fed) or European Central Bank (ECB) could never admit that the number one cryptocurrency is an “interesting concept.” Instead, ECB President Christine Lagarde repeatedly referred to Bitcoin as “worth nothing” and a “speculative investment with no intrinsic value”
