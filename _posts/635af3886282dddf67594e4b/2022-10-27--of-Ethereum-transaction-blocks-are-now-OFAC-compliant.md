At 63%, the number of blocks in compliance with U.S. sanctions on Ethereum continues to grow, adding to concerns over censorship.

## Highlights

- 63% of all transaction blocks on the Ethereum blockchain are compliant with OFAC sanctions, according to MEV Watch.
- The metric is all but assured to drive a continued debate over the use of MEV relays.
- The most widely used among those relays is Flashbots, which said it would ignore transactions from the transaction mixing service, Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned earlier this year by the U.S.
- government.
- The number of blocks proposed via the Flashbots relay nearly doubled, from 2,210 on Sept.
- 25 to just over 4,000 by Oct.
