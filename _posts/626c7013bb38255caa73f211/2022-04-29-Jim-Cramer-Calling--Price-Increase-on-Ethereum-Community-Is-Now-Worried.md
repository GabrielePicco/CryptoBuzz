CNBC host not the best caller in the crypto market as majority of assets picked by him end up in limbo Get Latest news on Cryptocurrency Jim Cramer Calling

## Highlights

- Mad Money host Jim Cramer called for a 35% increase in the value of the cryptocurrency.
- Cramer’s call caused nothing but caution in the cryptocurrency community due to its string of losses, especially after its Netflix call, after which it fell 71%.
- The reason for such negative sentiment around the call has to do with Cramer's “magical” ability to call stocks just before they lose up to 70% of their value.
- Some in the crypto community have even called his calls “Cramer's curse” in the market.
- However, in the long term, ETH is now moving in the uptrend, only forming higher highs and lower lows.
