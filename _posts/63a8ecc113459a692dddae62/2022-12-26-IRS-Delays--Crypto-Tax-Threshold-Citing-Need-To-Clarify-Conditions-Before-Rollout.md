The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is delaying rolling out its new $600 reporting threshold for third-party settlements, saying that more clarity is needed before it can kick off.

## Highlights

- The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is delaying rolling out its new $600 reporting threshold for third-party settlements.
- The new threshold was enacted as a part of the American Rescue Plan of 2021.
- The IRS has designated 2022 as a “transition period” for the implementation of the new threshold.
- The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements.
- According to Acting IRS Commissioner Doug O’Donnell, the additional time is needed to help taxpayers cleanly transition to the new system.
- The Daily Hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets.
