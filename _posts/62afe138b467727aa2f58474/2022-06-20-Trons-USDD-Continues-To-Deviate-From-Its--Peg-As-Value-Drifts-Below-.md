Given what happened to UST in recent weeks, that return to the peg is not a guarantee. If anything, USDD may be the next stablecoin to go from $1 to $0.05.

## Highlights

- Tron's USDD is the latest stablecoin to depeg from the $1 value.
- The currency is supposed to provide an annual yield of 30%.
- Users can redeem USDD for US$1 if the price exceeds the peg, but it continues to drift lower.
- USDD recently hit an all-time low of $0.947, although the price may drift lower in the coming hours and days.
- Similar to what happened to UST, USDD may be the next stablecoin that goes from $1 to $0.05 and lower in a few weeks.
- Developments like these will not get more people interested in algorithmic stablecoins but rather turn off people from the industry altogether.
