RadioShack relaunched its Twitter account this week with a stream of crude tweets filled with crude comments and drug references. It's not the electronics store Americans ran to for generations, but rather an online cryptocurrency company that also sells batteries

## Highlights

- RadioShack was delisted by New York Stock Exchange in 2015.
- The 100-year-old retailer reintroduced itself on Twitter this week with a stream of often-profane tweets.
- The company went from having roughly 5,200 U.S.
- stores in 2014 to about 400 when private equity firm Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV) purchased it in 2020.
- In a May statement, the company reported trading volume of $40 million, with a daily average of $500,000 to $2 million.
- “There is a real generational gap between the average crypto user and the average business decision maker,” the company said.
