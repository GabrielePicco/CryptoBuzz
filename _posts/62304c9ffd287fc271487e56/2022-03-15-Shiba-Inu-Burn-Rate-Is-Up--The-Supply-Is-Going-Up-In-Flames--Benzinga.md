## Highlights

- Major memecoin Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) saw an astonishing uptick in the rate at which its tokens are being burned.

- So far, over 410.3 trillion ShIB tokens have been burned for a total value nearing $9 billion as of press time.
- At the end of January, Steven Cooper — the CEO of Bigger Entertainment — said that he can reach $0.01 thanks to his company's regular SHIB burn events.
