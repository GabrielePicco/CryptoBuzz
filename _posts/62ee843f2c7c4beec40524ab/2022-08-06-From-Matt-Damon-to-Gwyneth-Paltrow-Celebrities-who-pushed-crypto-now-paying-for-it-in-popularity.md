How to attract a distrustful middle class to invest in unknown territory? With famous faces who are now facing public wrath after the collapse of virtual assets

## Highlights

- Matt Damonâ€™s participation in Crypto.com publicity masquerade no longer seems so innocent, writes Aaron Carroll.
- Carroll: After decades slowly building an image of a normal guy, unchanged by fame and fortune, he ended up linked to a financial disaster, the object of public scorn.
- He has opted for a tactical retreat, limiting his public appearances until the storm quiets, Carroll writes.
- Carroll says the actor isn't the only celebrity whose reputation has suffered after the apocalypse apocalypse outcasts are outcasts, such as Cara Delene and Ellen Degeneene Degeneres.
- The British model has been scorned for participating in a campaign in which an NFT of her vagina was auctioned.
