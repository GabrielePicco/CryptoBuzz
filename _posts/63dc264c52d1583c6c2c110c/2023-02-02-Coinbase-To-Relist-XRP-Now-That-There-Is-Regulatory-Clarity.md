Following John Deaton's success against the SEC, the XRP community is calling for Coinbase to relist XRP. Will it succeed?

## Highlights

- The community is hopeful that XRP could be relisted on Coinbase following the success of attorney John E. Deaton who won what is believed to be regulatory clarity regarding secondary market sales of cryptocurrencies earlier this week.
- Deaton and LBRY's legal team and Deaton succeeded in getting the SEC to confirm on the record that secondary market sale of cryptocurrencies, for example by exchanges, do not constitute securities transactions.
- As of press time, the XRP price was at $0.4146, still trading below the crucial resistance at $1.43 at press time.
- Ripple legal counsel Stuart Alderoty recently stated that he expects a decision in the first half of the year.
