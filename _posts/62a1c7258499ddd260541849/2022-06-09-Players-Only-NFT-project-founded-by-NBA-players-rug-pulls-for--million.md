title:  "Players Only NFT project, founded by NBA players, rug pulls for $1.4 million"
description: "Crypto-sleuth zachxbt reported on June 8 that Players Only, and NFT project created by a group of NBA players including Michael Carter-Williams and Jerami Grant, appears to be a rug pull. The players used their star power to drum up interest in the project and its somewhat unsettling NFTs of various bobblehead-esque sports players. The project promised close involvement from the athletes who founded it, with a roadmap advertising autographed merchandise, real life and metaverse meetups with the players, and other giveaways.Although the project team promised that \"every single one of our holders will win something\", the collectors were in for a lot of disappointment: players never showed up for events, and Zoom meetups were never scheduled despite repeated requests, and merchandise was never sent. One person who was promised a signed jersey instead received a t-shirt, apparently devoid of any signature.In mid-May, two project creators announced they would be \"stepping back on the project as [they] cannot seem to please the community\". The announcement broadly blamed the project's failures on \"lack of interest\" in the project. They said they would no longer be providing physical items, and would focus on \"athlete utility\", though in the time since then the project has remained similarly stagnant.Collectors minted Players Only NFTs in early December for 0.08 ETH each (~$144). One NFT from the project has been sold on the secondary market in the last month, for $0.001 ETH (less than $2)."
