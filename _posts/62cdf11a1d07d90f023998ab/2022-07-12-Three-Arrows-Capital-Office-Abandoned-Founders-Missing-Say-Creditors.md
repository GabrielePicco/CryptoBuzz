The company's Singapore Office was found abandoned by representatives tasked with helping liquidate the firm after its bankruptcy filing.

## Highlights

- Three Arrows Capital founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies are missing, court-appointed liquidators say.
- Liquidators found their Singapore office locked door and piles of old mail.
- 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in June after Voyager Digital collapsed.
- Earlier this month, KuCoinâ€™s native token tanked on rumors it was insolvent, and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy last week in New York.
- Meanwhile, crypto lender Nexo announced plans to acquire rival Vauld after it halted client withdrawals, and crypto lender Vauld has also filed for a similar bankruptcy filing in the U.S.
- The founders of 3AC are not cooperating with liquidators, they say.
