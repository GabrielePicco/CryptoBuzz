Exchange of derivatives Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, wrote today to express his opinions on the impact of the Ethereum merger...

## Highlights

- Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, wrote today to express his opinions on the impact of the Ethereum merger.
- If the Fed changes and Merge is successful, he predicts that ETH will reach $5,000.
- Hayes says the Fed is raising interest rates at their quickest rate in decades despite inflation showing no signs of slowing down and the likelihood of an economic collapse increasing as monetary policy has been tightened.
- According to Arthur, the Fedâ€™s projections for the future direction of monetary policy lead to easing in 2019.
- Risk asset markets may therefore have reached their bottom and may soon resume trading in cheaper, more plentiful dollars, he says.
