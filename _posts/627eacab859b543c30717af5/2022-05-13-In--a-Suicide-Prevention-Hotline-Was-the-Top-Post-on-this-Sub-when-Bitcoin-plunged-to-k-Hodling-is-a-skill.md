Bitcoin's price dip Tuesday shows that the cryptocurrency is still volatile.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price dropped from $13,000 USD per 1.0 BTC to $10,000 on Tuesday.
- That's down from an all-time high of $19,000 in mid-December.
- Bitcoin has crashed several times in the past, and it’s notorious for its volatility.
- A mini-crash may seem catastrophic now, but the past tells us that Tuesday's dip was just classic Bitcoin.
- We’re all along for the Bitcoin ride, but there's still a lot of money behind Bitcoin.
- If Bitcoin's not a stable store of value, what is it?
