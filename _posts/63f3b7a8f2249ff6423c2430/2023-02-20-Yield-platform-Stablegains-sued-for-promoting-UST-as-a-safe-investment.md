A lawsuit has been filed in a Californian district court seeking damages from DeFi yield platform Stablegains, which has been shuttered since May.

## Highlights

- Decentralized finance yield platform Stablegains has been sued in a Californian court for misleading investors and failing to comply with securities laws.
- Alec and Artin Ohanian filed a complaint in the U.S.
- District Court for the central district of California on Feb.
- 18, alleging that the firm diverted all of its customer funds to the Anchor Protocol without their knowledge or consent.
- The plaintiffs also allege that UST (UST) was a security.
- UST de-pegged from the dollar, causing a broader run on DeFi and crypto markets in May and an eventual loss of around $18 billion from the Terra/Luna ecosystem.
