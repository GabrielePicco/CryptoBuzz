Craig Wright, who claims to have invented Bitcoin, has lost a claim to protect the format of the blockchain by copyright, a U.K. judge ruled.

## Highlights

- Computer scientist Craig Wright lost a claim to protect Bitcoin's format by copyright.
- Wright claimed that Bitcoin forks, spin-offs derived from the cryptocurrency, breached his intellectual property rights because he created the original digital asset.
- A UK court threw out the claim on Tuesday, with Judge James Mellor saying: "I do not see any prospect of the law as currently stated and understood in the caselaw allowing copyright protection of subject-matter which is not expressed or fixed anywhere" There have been many Bitcoin forks but the largest is Bitcoin Cash, the 28th-largest digital asset, with a market cap of $2.56 billion.
- Wright has never been able to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto.
