NFT data aggregator Cryptoslam has flagged more than half a billion dollars worth of NFT wash trades related to Blur since the marketplace’s Valentines airdrops started

## Highlights

- Cryptoslam has detected at least US$577 million worth of wash traded non-fungible tokens (NFT) related to the up-and-coming marketplace, Blur.io, since the platform started airdropping its native tokens to users on Valentine’s Day, Feb.
- 14.
- The behavior suggests that some Blur users have been selling NFTs to themselves using different wallets to acquire Blur tokens (BLUR) and accrue points for airdrop airdros.
- The wash trades also raised global sales volume to the highest level since January 2022, creating a false sense of a resurgent NFT market.
