The world's largest metaverse Horizon Worlds has dwindled to less than 1,000 daily active users, according to Jarvis Johnson.

## Highlights

- YouTuber Jarvis Johnson spent a week living in Meta’s Horizon Worlds, the most popular metaverse.
- Horizon Worlds has fewer than 1,000 English-speaking users, according to Johnson.
- Children rampantly circumvent Zuckerberg's poorly-enforced age limits and overwhelm gameplay.
- Johnson described mini-games in the metaverse as ‘janky’ and moving around felt stiff when he used default settings.
- The vast majority of games involved bouncing balls, all of which grew tired after a couple days of gameplay.
- The world's largest metaverse has dwindled to less than 900 daily active users, and alternate metaverses barely exist beyond a marketing buzzword.
