## Highlights

- Bakkt commissioned a study that shows women are investing in cryptocurrencies and closing the gender gap.
- The study measures “awareness and attitudes toward cryptocurrency among women, who both own and do not own crypto, and, how it differs from men who own.
- Bakkt found out that: “Men were early crypto adopters, but women are now outpacing men as first-time purchasers.
- 38% of women made their first crypto purchase in past 6 months compared to 30% of men.” The majority of women (61%) own less than $500 in crypto.
- 70% of no-coiners rate “their crypto knowledge as low or very low,” which compares to only 13% of male crypto owners.
