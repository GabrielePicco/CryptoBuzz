Kraken has conducted an independent audit showing it has nearly $20 billion worth of BTC and ETH. It will also allow clients to verify their accounts using third-party services.

## Highlights

- The audit was conducted by Armanino LLP, a consulting firm in the US.
- Results didn't include other assets, including the $3.5 billion worth of ETH.
- The audit took several years of work to reconstruct a Merkle tree, a mathematical data structure that encapsulates blocks of data.
- Any client will be able to independently verify their balances by comparing select pieces of data with the data.
- It will also allow clients to use non-fungible tokens as collateral to borrow funds against each other.
- Kraken is one of the most active crypto-currency exchanges in the world.
