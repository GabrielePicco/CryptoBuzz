Taylor Swift began discussing a $100 million-tour sponsorship with FTX in the fall of 2021, per the Financial Times.

## Highlights

- Lawyer says Taylor Swift pulled out of a $100 million-tour sponsorship deal with FTX because she was the only celebrity to question the crypto exchange's legality.
- Lawsuit claims celebrities didn't do their due diligence to check whether FTX was breaking the law.
- The SEC said the company's cryptocurrency, FTT, is classified as a security because it was sold as an investment contract.
- The crypto exchange imploded last November after concerns that the commingling of funds with its sister firm, Alameda, led to mass-customer withdrawals.
- It didn't have enough money to fulfill that demand, partly due to lavish spending and a $65 billion line of credit, lawyers said.
