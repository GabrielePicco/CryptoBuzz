More than 4,000 coins listed on CoinGecko in 2021 are now ‘dead coins.’

## Highlights

- Data from CoinGecko shows nearly 1,900 crypto projects listed in 2022 have already failed.
- This adds to an astonishing 4,367 crypto projects that were listed in 2021 and have since died.
- Despite the huge number of cryptos that have disappeared, 2021 was a boom time for the market.
- Speculative investments like meme stocks took off in early 2021, thanks partly to a massive increase in government spending and lax interest rates.
- Experts have said investing in the better known tokens when you’re starting out, like bitcoin and ether, may be the way to go.
- As exciting as crypto’s price ups and downs, crypto in general is a risky asset class.
