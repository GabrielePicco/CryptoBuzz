Jim Cramer cashed out of his crypto investments in 2021 and bought a farm with the earnings.

## Highlights

- Cramer cashed out of his crypto investments in 2021 and bought a farm with the earnings.
- Cramer sold all of his Bitcoin BTC/USD and bought ETH/USD instead, noting that people actually use the latter to transact.
- He sold his position after he found out his bank was unwilling to accept it.
- His comments came as Bitcoin and ETH had fallen more than 65% by the end of 2022, as the industry battled several headwinds, including the undoing of crypto exchange FTX.
- Cramer reminded crypto investors that it's never too late to sell, even though Cramer had been a customer of his bank for 30 years.
