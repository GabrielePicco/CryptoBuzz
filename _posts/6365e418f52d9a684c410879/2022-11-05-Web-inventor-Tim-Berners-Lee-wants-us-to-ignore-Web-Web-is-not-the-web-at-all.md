Berners-Lee said people too often conflate Web3 with \"Web 3.0,\" his own proposal for reshaping the internet.

## Highlights

- Tim Berners-Lee says he doesn't view blockchain as a viable solution for building the next iteration of the internet.
- He has his own web decentralization project called Solid.
- The creator of the web isn't sold on crypto visionaries' plan for its future and says we should "ignore" it.
- "In fact, Web3 is not the web at all," he said.
- The term is a nebulous term in the tech world used to describe a hypothetical future version of internet that's more decentralized than it is today.
- The movement has been a punching bag for some leaders in Silicon Valley, like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.
