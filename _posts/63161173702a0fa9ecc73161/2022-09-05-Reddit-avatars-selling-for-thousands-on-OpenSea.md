Reddit collectible NFT avatars are now selling for thousands of dollars on secondary markets and are showing no signs of slowing down.

## Highlights

- Reddit released a collection of limited edition NFT avatars last month.
- The NFTs are minted on the Polygon blockchain as an NFT (Non Fungible Token) and are easy to mint.
- Some of those early edition avatars that sold out are fetching over 1.33 eth ($2,000) on OpenSea (the most popular NFT marketplace) in just a few days.
- There are currently quite a few collections still in stock that could easily appreciate over time.
- The Senses collection has seen the most big ticket sales with over 8.1 eth in total volume.
- Another collection is slowly closing the gap between Foustlings created by Tyler Foustling.
