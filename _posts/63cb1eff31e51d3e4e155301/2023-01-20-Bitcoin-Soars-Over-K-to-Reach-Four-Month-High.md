## Highlights

- This week’s larger-than-expected decline in the producer price index (PPI) indicated the U.S.
- Federal Reserve’�s monetary hawkishness has been taming inflation, buoying investors.
- Bitcoin rose over 5% and hit its highest level since mid-September.
- FOMC is expected to raise rates by just 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) at its next meeting in February – slowing from the 50 basis-point hikes in the December meeting.
