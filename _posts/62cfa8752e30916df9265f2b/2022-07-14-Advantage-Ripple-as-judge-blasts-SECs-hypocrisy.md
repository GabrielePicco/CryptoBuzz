Ripple's battle with the SEC has suddenly swung in the crypto company's favour with a key legal ruling over the 'Hinman speech' evidence.

## Highlights

- US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ripple Labs with raising $1.3 billion in unregistered digital asset securities offering.
- Case hinges around Ripple Labs’ XRP token, which the SEC claims is a security.
- Ripple’s lawyers have been adamant that the Hinman speech is critical evidence that could shatter the case against them.
- Judge Sarah Netburn threw out the SEC motion to have the speech effectively ring-fenced from the case under ‘client-attorney privilege’ and labelled the motion ‘hypocrisy’ by the Magistrate Judge Netburn.
- Ripple's lawyers describe the ruling as a 'body slam'
