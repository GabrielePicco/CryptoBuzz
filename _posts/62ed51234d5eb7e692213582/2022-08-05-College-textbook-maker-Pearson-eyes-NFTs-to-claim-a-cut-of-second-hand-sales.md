Apparently, a $300 required textbook isn't enough of a grift..

## Highlights

- Pearson CEO Andy Bird said in 2019 it would focus on digital textbook sales.
- "In the analogue world, a Pearson textbook was resold up to seven times, and we would only participate in the first sale," he said.
- NFT advocates tout the technology's ability to grant the creator a cut of second-hand sales as one of its major attributes.
- Others are looking at NFTs to earn a buck from the secondary market too, including the publishers of college textbooks.
- Selling on a textbook when it's no longer needed just makes sense.
- Digital rights management already exists and doesn't need to go anywhere near cryptocurrency, Bird said.
