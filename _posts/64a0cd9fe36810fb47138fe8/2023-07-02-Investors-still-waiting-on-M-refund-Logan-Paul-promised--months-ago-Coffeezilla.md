Logan Paul’s legal counsel vaguely stated that they are still working with him to figure out the best way to issue refunds to investors.

## Highlights

- Logan Paul’s nonfungible token (NFT) gaming project CryptoZoo was launched in September 2021, intending to be an NFT breeding game offering opportunities to earn ZOO tokens and NFTs.
- However, with lackluster NFT artwork seemingly ripped from Adobe stock images, tanking NFT and ZOO token prices, and an apparent failure to deliver on the roadmap, investors became disgruntled by late 2022.
- Paul ultimately announced a plan to refund investors on January 14 and vowed to deliver.
- Paul was slapped with a class-action lawsuit the following month.
- Paul's legal counsel vaguely stated that they are still working with him to figure out the best way to issue refunds to investors.
