Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade is scheduled for epoch 194048 at around 11 pm UTC on April 12, barely two days away at press time.

## Highlights

- The Shanghai-Capella upgrade scheduled for April 12 should unlock over $30 billion in staked ETH on the Bitcoin-Ethereum chain.
- Shapella, a mix of the Shanghai and Capella upgrades, will unlock over 16 million ETH deposited in the chain’s staking contract since December 2020.
- Entities have locked ETH a staggering amount of ETH since 2020 to secure their place as validators – the people who help manage the network by authenticating transactions and securing the chain.
- The coming unlock also raises concerns of sell pressure in the market, with concerns of centralization concerns.
- ETH was up 1.30% and traded at $1860 on Monday.
