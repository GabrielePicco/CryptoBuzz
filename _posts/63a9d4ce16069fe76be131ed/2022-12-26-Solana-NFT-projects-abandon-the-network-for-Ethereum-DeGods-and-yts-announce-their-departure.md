Solana is considered the second largest NFT ecosystem in the world. Interestingly, the Ethereum-alternative is in a tough spot with top digital collec

## Highlights

- Solana is considered the second largest NFT ecosystem in the world.
- Project DeGods and y00ts have revealed plans to migrate to rival blockchains Etheria and Polygon.
- Solana price is 95.6% below its all-time high of $259.56 and currently trading at $11.33.
- The outlook on Solana remains bearish in 2022.
- A drop to the monthly low of $10.94 is likely for the Ethereum-alternative.
- If Solana breaks out of its downtrend with a close above the trendline, it could invalidate the bearish thesis.
