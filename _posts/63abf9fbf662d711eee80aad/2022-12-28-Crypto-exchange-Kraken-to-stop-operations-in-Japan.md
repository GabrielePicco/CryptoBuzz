U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken said on Wednesday it would cease its operations in Japan next month, citing the current market conditions in the country and a weak crypto market globally.

## Highlights

- Kraken will deregister from the Financial Services Agency (JFSA) as of Jan.
- 31, by which time clients would have to withdraw their fiat and crypto holdings.
- Kraken said it would reduce its workforce by 30%, or about 1,100 employees, as tough market conditions had crippled demand for digital assets.
- Bitcoin, the pre-eminent cryptocurrency, has lost 60% of its value this year, while the wider crypto market has shrunk by $1.4 trillion, squashed by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX empire, Celsius and supposed'stablecoins' terraUSD and Luna.
- The exchange said it is fully funded to ensure that all affected clients could withdraw their assets in a timely manner.
