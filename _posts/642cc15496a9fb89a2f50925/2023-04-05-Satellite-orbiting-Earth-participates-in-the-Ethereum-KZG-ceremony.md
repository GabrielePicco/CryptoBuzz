Crypto2 orbits Earth every 90 minutes while following a remote course 550 km above ground, making it difficult for outside actors to gain access during the KZG contribution.

## Highlights

- Cryptosat, a blockchain-powered satellite orbiting Earth, announced its contribution of entropy from space on April 4 at 6 a.m.
- UTC.
- The contribution will be deployed from the Crypto2 satellite, which orbits Earth every 90 minutes while following a remote course 550 km above ground.
- The Bitcoin KZG ceremony has already had over 83,000 contributions of randomness from users all over the world.
- The commitment of entropy will be viewable in real-time via a dashboard monitoring the satelliteâ€™s trajectory and latest status.
- The second satellite, Crypto2, was launched into space on Jan.
