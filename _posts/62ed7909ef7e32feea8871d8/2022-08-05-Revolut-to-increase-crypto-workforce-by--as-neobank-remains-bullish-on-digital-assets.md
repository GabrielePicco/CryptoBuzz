## Highlights

- is planning to grow its crypto workforce by 20% in the next six months.
- The challenger bank has recently listed job ads for 13 crypto-related positions, such as in departments for compliance and financial prevention, software engineering and legal affairs.
- According to Emil Urmanshin, the company is unfazed by the recent slump in the crypto market but is instead focused on clientsâ€™ growing interest in digital assets.
