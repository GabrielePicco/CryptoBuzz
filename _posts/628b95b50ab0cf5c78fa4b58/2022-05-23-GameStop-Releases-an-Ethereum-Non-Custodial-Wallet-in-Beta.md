GameStop has released an Ethereum non-custodial wallet in Beta for users to securely store fungible and non-fungible assets.

## Highlights

- GameStop has released a Beta version of a non-custodial wallet compatible with Ethereum.
- The wallet is free to download and is available for all users interested in securely storing diverse assets, including non-fungible assets like NFTs.
- It will feature a built-in DEX in partnership with Loopring, an Ethereum layer-2 platform with comparatively low trading fees.
- It would also allow users to connect directly to the GameStop NFT marketplace for trading assets such as gaming skins and weapons.
- At the moment, the wallet would be freely accessible to all users, regardless of their geographical location.
- However, the platform is currently dedicating its resources to user education.
