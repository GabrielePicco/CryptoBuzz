Helium listed Lime and Salesforce as users of its crypto mesh network. Both companies deny it, raising doubts about who’s actually using the network.

## Highlights

- Helium's parent company is backed by Andreessen Horowitz and is a crypto-powered network.
- It's a decentralized mesh network where users pay to use the network instead of cellular data.
- Salesforce, whose logo appeared on Helium’s website, says that it also doesn’t use the technology.
- A report from The Generalist says that only around $6,500 worth of data credits were spent to access Helium last month.
- Members of the r/helium subreddit have been increasingly vocal about seeing poor Helium returns.
- Helium was praised by The New York Times earlier this year and its parent company, which has its own crypto-backed investment firm, has been accused of misleading people about its partners.
