Crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon's TerraUSD and luna tokens are crumbling, despite his insistence that critics were merely jealous of his wealth.

## Highlights

- TerraUSD founder Do Kwon has a history of dismissing critics by labelling them 'poor' His TerraUSD and luna tokens are now crumbling as confidence evaporates from the tokens.
- Kwon mocked an economist who criticized TerraUSD's design by saying he doesn't "debate with poor people" TerraUSD is a so-called algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to maintain its peg to $1 by encouraging traders to trade the asset in exchange for the luna cryptocurrency.
- The project all but imploded this week when TerraUSD slid to well below the $1 mark, with the loss of confidence sending sister cryptocurrency luna tumbling from around $80 to below $0.05.
