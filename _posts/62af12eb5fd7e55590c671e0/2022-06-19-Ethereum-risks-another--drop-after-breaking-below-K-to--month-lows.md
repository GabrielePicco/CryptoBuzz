A 2018-like bearish cycle could have Ether drop toward $420 in the coming weeks.

## Highlights

- Ether reached $975, its lowest level since January 2021, losing 80% of its value from its record high in November 2021.
- The decline appeared amid concerns about the Federal Reserve's 75 basis points rate hike, a move that pushed both cryptocurrencies and stocks into a strong bear market.
- The Federal Reserve has barely started raising rates, and for the record, they haven't sold anything on their balance sheet either," said Nick, an analyst at data resource Ecoinometrics, warning that "there is bound to be more downside coming" A 2018-like bearish cycle could have Ether drop toward $420 in the coming weeks, if the drawdown turns out to be anything like its 2018 bear cycle.
