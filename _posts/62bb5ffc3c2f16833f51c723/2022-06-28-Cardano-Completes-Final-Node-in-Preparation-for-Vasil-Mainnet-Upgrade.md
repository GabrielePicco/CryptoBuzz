Cardano has completed their final node & and released for the preparation of the Vasil Mainnet upgrade. The node was the final candidate.

## Highlights

- The Cardano networkâ€™s next Vasil upgrade aims to increase the performance and functionality of the Ouroboros-based proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform.
- The new node is reportedly ready to be deployed onto the Vasil testnet, and the Stake Pool Operation (SPO) communities sponsoring it have reportedly been informed.
- The Vasil hard fork combinator event will no longer take place in June 2022 due to a few small problems, the IOG team previously announced.
- This next upgrade is named after Cardano's long-time community member, Vasil St Dabov.
- The mainnet Vasil update will be implemented using the strictest procedure.
