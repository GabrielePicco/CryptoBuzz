The unnamed man worked reasonably succesfully as a content creator but saw his salary rise from around £25,000 to ten times that amount when he took a punt on virtual trading in 2014

## Highlights

- The unnamed man worked as a content creator but saw his salary rise from around £25,000 to ten times that amount when he took a punt on virtual trading in 2014.
- The investor, who opened up on a Reddit thread, said last year that he feels like he's used a "cheat code" and doesn't deserve the fortune after a 'lucky bet' He said he "never acquired a taste for expensive things" when he lived more frugally, and instead saved a chunk of his salary each year.
- He kept working, but "way less" for almost two years as the "excitement was stripped from doing work"
