The creator of popular meme token Dogecoin (DOGE) is rejecting an offer worth millions of dollars in digital assets to promote an unofficial offshoot crypto project.

## Highlights

- Billy Markus, co-founder of the dog-themed crypto asset, has rejected an offer of 10 billion DOGE, worth about $14 million at time of writing.
- Markus says that “no one really cares anyway” if rejecting the offer avoided betraying the community.
- Dogechain is an unofficial project not affiliated with the popular meme coin or its founders.
- It aims to bridge the gap between Dogecoin and Web3, a blockchain project that aims to be a "Dogechain" project.
- The Daily Hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets, nor is an investment advisor.
