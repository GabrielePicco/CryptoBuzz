The failures of the two digital currency financial platforms have shaken investor faith in firms that underpin the nascent crypto industry.

## Highlights

- Yotsy Ruiz recently bought his first ever crypto hardware wallet — a Nano X from Ledger.com.
- He is transferring all his crypto holdings that he can still move to the small physical device which looks like a USB flash drive.
- His holdings, including more than 11,110 Cardano and 360,000 Terra Luna Classic among others, are today worth about $5,000.
- Voyager Digital, which he trusted with some of his savings, froze all user withdrawals at the start of July and filed for bankruptcy protection.
- Celsius Network, which said it had more than 1.7 million customers, stopped all customer withdrawals in June and filed bankruptcy protection on Wednesday.
