CEX trading volumes rose by 23.7% in November, while DEX volumes jumped 93.2%.

## Highlights

- Cryptocurrency exchange volumes rose by 24% to $673 billion in November, up from $543 billion in October.
- Decentralized (DEX) exchanges, excluding layer 2's, saw a substantially bigger increase, with volume doubling to $65 billion from $34 billion.
- November marked a recovery for crypto exchange volumes, which reached an almost two-year low in October, according to The Block's data.
- The Block Research's Lars Hoffman attributed the increases to the "collapse of FTX and subsequent de-risking" from CEX's to on-chain exchanges, Hoffman said.
- Curve, an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum, saw an increase of 371% in volume.
