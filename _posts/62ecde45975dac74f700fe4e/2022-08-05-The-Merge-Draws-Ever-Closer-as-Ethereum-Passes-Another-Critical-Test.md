Passing the latest in a series of critical tests ahead of The Merge, Ethereum completed the tenth mainnet shadow fork on July 27.

## Highlights

- The Merge is the largest upgrade in Ethereum’s history, with pundits likening it to changing the engine of an airplane mid-flight.
- The upgrade will unify the ‘Eth2’ Proof of Stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain, with the existing execution layer.
- The Merge must first undergo 20 shadow forks and three public testnet deployments before it hits the mainnet in mid-September.
- The move will trade miners for validators, driving in a 90% drop in new ETH issuance and a more than 99% reduction in the electricity consumption of the network.
- Ether has soared 36% in the last 30 days, three times better than Bitcoin's 10% jump.
