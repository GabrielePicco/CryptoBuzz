## Highlights

- The majority of those who do not own cryptocurrencies consider entering the ecosystem in the near future.
- The current macroeconomic conditions have made it tough for millennials to invest in any type of asset.
- Another recent poll estimated that 36% of millennials and 51% of Generation Z would prefer to receive half of their paychecks in digital currencies instead of fiat.
- 47% of millionaires had distributed at least 1/4 of their wealth in digital assets, another survey determined.
- Real estate remains the most appealing investment option to US millennials, as 77% allocated funds to properties.
