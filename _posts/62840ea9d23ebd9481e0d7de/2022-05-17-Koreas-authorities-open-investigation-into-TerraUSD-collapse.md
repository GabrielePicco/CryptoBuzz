Financial authorities have begun investigating a massive cryptocurrency crash involving TerraUSD and its sister token Luna. The group is seeking to determine ways to prevent similar losses for investors in the future.

## Highlights

- South Korean authorities are looking into the collapse of TerraUSD and its sister coin, LUNA.
- Financial authorities in South Korea have launched an investigation to reveal the saga behind the LUNA crash.
- The aim is to provide clarity for the future of stablecoins and protect the interests of investors.
- The most prominent stablecoin on the Terra blockchain, TerraUSD (UST), has plummeted over 85%, with some likening the incident to a Ponzi scheme comparable to that of Lehman Brothers.
- Some first-time investors were left confused about what happened, and there are a few theories that there was a ‘concerted attack” on Terra ecosystem in which the claimed attacker made off with $800 million.
