Fidelity Investment's crypto arm, Fidelity Digital Assets, launched commission-free trading on the two largest assets by market cap in crypto to all users (old and new) recently.

## Highlights

- Fidelity Digital Assets quietly opened access to Fidelity Crypto for the masses recently.
- The firm will charge a spread of no more than 1% commission-free trading.
- Withdrawals haven't yet been enabled on the platform.
- The launch coincided with an increasingly hot regulatory environment in the U.S.
- and the collapse of two of crypto's biggest banking partners, Silvergate and Signature Bank.
- Fidelity, which 37.1 million total retail accounts, has acted sooner than most of its peers in the market in offering crypto to retail clients.
