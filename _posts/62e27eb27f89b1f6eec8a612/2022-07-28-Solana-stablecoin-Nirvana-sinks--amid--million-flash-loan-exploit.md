The attacker used a $10 million flash loan from Solana lending pool Solend to drain $3.5 million from the Nirvana treasury.

## Highlights

- Nirvana Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield protocol on Solana, suffered a flash loan exploit to the tune of about $3.5 million.
- Nirvana's native token ANA and stablecoin NIRV suffered massive price falls due to the attack.
- ANA slipped 89% from $8.97 to $0.93 while the stablecoin has lost 90% of its US dollar value in the process.
- The attacker manipulated the protocolâ€™s oracle feed thereby inflating the price of ANA coins so that their holdings exceeded $10 million.
- This flash loan was secured on the Solend Protocol.
- The exploited has since repaid the initial $10million loan and has bridged the profit to this wallet address via Wormhole and converted it to the DAI stablecoin.
