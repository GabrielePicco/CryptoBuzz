## Highlights

- The "Let’s Go Brandon" cryptocurrency has fallen on the heels of a NASCAR driver's race car sponsorship.
- The coin, which carries the saying “Let's Go, Brandon,” became a pro-Trump rallying cry at the end of last year.
- The value of all 330 trillion coins totals just a few thousand dollars combined, according to the trading sites CoinMarketCap and Crypto.
- That represents a 99.5 percent decline over the last 30 days, leaving a singular LGB coin effectively worthless.
- An attorney who has represented aggrieved crypto investors since 2014 says the coin's collapse was a foregone conclusion.
- The group behind LGB pledged to “airdrop” investors a new and improved coin.
