Tallying the losses after last year’s Super Bowl crypto-advertising bonanza.

## Highlights

- Fox Sports exec says crypto will have "zero representation" during the Super Bowl.
- Last year's game coincided with the peak for the crypto industry, fueled by lockdown-inspired interest in alternative currencies as well as mass hype around nonfungible tokens.
- Fox Sports’ parent company, Fox Corporation, was also revealed to be an FTX corporate creditor during the latter’s bankruptcy proceedings.
- The Associated Press reported Sunday that multiple crypto-ad deals had been on the table for this year's Super Bowl, until FTX went under and demolished everything.
- The new year hasn't given this sector much relief, and crypto funds aren’t going to rebound in time for another Super Bowl commercial.
