President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday asked U.S. senators to stay out of El Salvador's \"internal affairs\" after they called for an investigation into the economic risks the United States faces due to the Central American country's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender.

## Highlights

- President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday asked U.S.
- senators to stay out of El Salvador's "internal affairs" Senators Jim Risch, Bill Cassidy and Bob Mendez asked the State Department to submit a report on the implementation of bitcoin in El Salvador.
- El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt cryptocurrency for official use, in parallel to the US dollar, a decision that has drawn it harsh criticism from the International Monetary Fund.
- The Salvadoran government has acquired some 1,801 bitcoins since September, which has been questioned by economists and the opposition for its refusal to be accountable in the process of buying and managing the funds.
