Internet personality Logan Paul isn't just trading blows in the boxing ring. Now he's now picking a fight to defend his disastrous NFT game CryptoZoo.

## Highlights

- Logan Paul has released a response video defending his NFT game CryptoZoo.
- The game was meant to earn players passive income by allowing them to hatch and breed NFT "eggs" Paul's explanation?
- He says he accidentally hired scammers of his own to develop the app, who then did some scamming.
- Paul calls out several "bad actors," who he says may or may not have stolen millions of dollars from investors, but were later fired.
- Paul has spent years trying to salvage what was left of his image after visiting a "suicide forest" in Japan back in 2017, a horrifying misstep that made him synonymous with trashy YouTube clickbait.
