Two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the stock picks of television personality Jim Cramer. Called Inverse Cramer ETF and Long CramerETF, the two funds will allow investors to take a short or long

## Highlights

- Two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the stock picks of television personality Jim Cramer.
- The Inverse Cramer ETF will bet against Cramerâ€™s stock recommendations.
- Cramer is a popular American television personality and author.
- Social media is loaded with bad recommendations of the author, with many joking that a suggestion is a death kiss and vice versa because the stocks he promotes drop badly, and the ones he goes negative on prove to be a potential bottom call.
- The S&P 500 (SPX), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) ended Wednesday down by 0.14%, 0.25%.
