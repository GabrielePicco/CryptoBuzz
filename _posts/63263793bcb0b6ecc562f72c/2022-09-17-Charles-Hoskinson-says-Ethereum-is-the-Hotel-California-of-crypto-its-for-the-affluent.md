Charles Hoskinson, the founder of IOG, has offered his thoughts on Ethereum’s recent transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake

## Highlights

- Charles Hoskinson has offered his thoughts on the recent transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof of-stake (PoS) network.
- Hoskinson made the remarks in response to the disclosure that the Kraken exchange is barring users from withdrawing their staked ETH tokens until the Shanghai upgrade is completed.
- A PoS network takes less energy to support a chain than a PoW network.
- Despite being one of the network’s inventors, Hoskinson recently referred to Ethereum as “the Hotel California of crypto.” He also claimed that Cardano investors are average folks who don’t have to be wealthy to participate in Cardano staking.
