James Howells' life changed when he threw away a hard drive about the size of an iPhone 6.

## Highlights

- James Howells, 36, wants to recover 8,000 bitcoins from a landfill in Newport, southern Wales.
- He says he has a $11 million plan to dig for hard drives in 110,000 tons of garbage.
- Local council has refused to let Howells go to the dump to retrieve the hard drives.
- Howells' team will use robotic dogs and a machine that looks like a scanner on conveyor belt to sift through the garbage.
- The plan includes 24-hour CCTV cameras and two robotic “spot’s dogs from Boston Dynamics that will act as mobile CCTV patrols at night and for anything that looks similar to the hard drive by day.
