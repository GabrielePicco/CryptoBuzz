Embattled Terra founder Do Kwon has effectively lost a total of $11 million on a bet that he took against two cryptocurrency traders in March.

## Highlights

- Embattled Terra founder Do Kwon has effectively lost a total of $11 million on a bet that he took against two cryptocurrency traders in March.
- The duo took a wager on the future price of LUNA, the native token of the Terra ecosystem.
- They each placed $1 million in a bet in which Kwon believed LUNA would trade above $88 by March 14 2023 â€“ exactly one year from the day of the bet.
- Kwon accepted yet another bet of $10 million with pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Gigantic Rebirth, under the same conditions as those agreed with Algod.
- All parties involved agreed to transfer the equivalent of $22 million in stablecoins to an escrow wallet managed by crypto influencer Jordan Fish.
