The firm’s app has seen an almost 2 million drop in regular users

## Highlights

- The value of assets held by the California-based business plummeted 31% in the three months to June.
- The firm posted a net loss of $295 million (£242 million), while transaction fees for stock trading sunk 19% to $29 million.
- The announcement marks the latest round of job cuts in the crypto sector as tech firms that went on a hiring spree during the crypto boom pare back their expansion plans as investor enthusiasm for digital assets dries up.
- The Bitcoin price has fallen 46% since January, while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index, which tracks the value of US-based tech firms, has dropped 26%.
- It comes as cyber criminals stole $200 million worth of digital assets from two crypto firms in the space of 24 hours.
