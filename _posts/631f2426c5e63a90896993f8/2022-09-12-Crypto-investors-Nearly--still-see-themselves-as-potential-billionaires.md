Crypto Investors: According to a recent study, getting rich on crypto is still the dream. This makes them susceptible to Ponzi schemes.

## Highlights

- Harris Poll Thought Leadership Practice study shows 70% of investors surveyed believe they could become billionaires thanks to the industry.
- Youngsters are more likely to turn to crypto in the face of a failing economic system, study finds.
- Some want to eliminate speculation within the sector, even while investors continue to see crypto as a way to make money.
- This situation can lure users into Ponzi schemes or other scams promising large monthly returns.
- Every crypto crash also gives the industry a bad name.
- With a community eager to see ETH gain in value, the project could attract new investors who are only interested in profit.
