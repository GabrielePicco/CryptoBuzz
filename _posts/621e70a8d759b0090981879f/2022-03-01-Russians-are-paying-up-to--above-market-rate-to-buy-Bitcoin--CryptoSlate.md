Sanctions bite leading to the collapse of the ruble. Data suggests Russians are turning to Bitcoin to protect themselves from the fallout.

## Highlights

- Media outlet DeFiprime.com noted Bitcoin is trading for up to $20,000 above the market rate on Russian exchanges.
- The “matreshka premium” is a spin on the kimchi premium, a term used to describe price difference between tokens on Korean exchanges compared to the rest of the world.
- It still exists today, but it’s much less prevalent, coming in around 5% above the price of Bitcoin.
- The outbreak of war last week sunk Bitcoin to $34,300, but a strong performance on Monday saw an 18% upside swing to close the day at $43,000.
- Data suggests Russians are turning to Bitcoin to protect themselves from the fallout.
