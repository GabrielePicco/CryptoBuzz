But as the billions of mining accessories purchased can't go wasted, miners tend toward Ethereum Classic (ETC) to continue work.

## Highlights

- ETCâ€™s hashrate, a measure to calculate the total power being used for mining, has skyrocketed by 280% in a day following the merge.
- Miners who closed their shop on the ETH network have moved to ETC as the ETH mining hardware is still compatible with the ETC's mining chip, Ethash.
- Vitalik Buterin, the founder of the network, also has been endorsing miners to move on to the Ethereum Classic to continue their work.
- ETC currently trades above $33, up by over 2% in the last hour.
- However, contrary to the higher mining activity, ETC lost over 10% in one day and more than 11% last week.
