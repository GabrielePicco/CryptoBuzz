DeFi Kingdoms is struggling to balance its in-game economy as an exploit affecting JEWEL token unlocking weighs on its price.

## Highlights

- GameFi project DeFi Kingdoms has seen the price of its JEWEL currency token retreat more than 90% from its January all-time highs.
- A recent exploit affecting the speed at which players can unlock their locked JewEL has also affected the tokenâ€™s price.
- In the past 24 hours, the token has fallen another 21% to a local low of $2.25.
- The number of active DeFi Kingdom players has halved over the past month, declining from 30,000 on Mar.
- 31 to approximately 15,000 today.
- The generous rewards given to players have created increased sell pressure without an influx of new players to balance the game's economy.
