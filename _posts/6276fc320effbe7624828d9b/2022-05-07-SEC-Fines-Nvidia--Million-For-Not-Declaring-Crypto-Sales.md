The GPU manufacturer has been fined by the SEC for covering up how volatile crypto boosted revenue

## Highlights

- Nvidia has been fined $5.5 million by the U.S.
- Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to tell investors how much of its 2017-18 revenue came about from crypto-miners.
- Nvidia reported $9.714 billion in revenue, of which half was credited to “Gaming,” but didn’t properly indicate the role crypto played in these figures.
- Nvidia was required to disclose this distinction on the very Brazil-sounding Forms 10-Q, but, say the SEC, did not despite having the information on hand.
- Nvidia declined to admit to or deny these findings, but instead to a cease-desist order, and to pay a $5 million penalty.
