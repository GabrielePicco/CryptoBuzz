## Highlights

- The head of one of the largest crypto exchanges says the Federal Reserve is responsible for this downturn.
- Sam Bankman-Fried says he appreciates the difficulty of what the central bank is trying to do, noting it is "caught between a rock and a hard place" The biggest worry is what effect this will have on the large universe of amateur investors who have loaded up on cryptocurrencies just in the past couple of years.
