As the crypto world battles the fallout from the collapse of the FTX exchange, Litecoin is likely to serve as a robust safe haven in 2023

## Highlights

- Litecoin (Litecoin) is likely to serve as a relatively robust safe haven in 2023, owing to the cryptocurrencyâ€™s halving event scheduled for later this year.
- Litecoin is now the second major cryptocurrency after Bitcoin to still use a Proof-of-Work (PoW) transaction authentication mechanism.
- Rekt Capital believes that Litecoin can rally by around 285 percent before August 2023.
- Thereafter, Litecoin will register a 60 percent retracement and enter a consolidation period, which would set the stage for new all-time highs in 2024.
- On a macroeconomic level, a possible recession in the US and the EU remains the most troubling headwind for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.
