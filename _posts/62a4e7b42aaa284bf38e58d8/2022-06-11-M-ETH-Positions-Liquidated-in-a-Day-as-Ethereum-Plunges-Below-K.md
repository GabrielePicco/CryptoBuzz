The number of total liquidations on a daily scale is close to $400 million, with ETH taking the majority of the share.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin and the rest of the market headed south hard yesterday, perhaps fueled by record-setting US inflation numbers.
- Bitcoin went from above $30,000 to below $29,000 rather quickly, but most of the altcoins suffered more.
- Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, and MATIC have lost close to 10% on a daily scale.
- Total market cap is down by over $80 billion in a day to $1.150 trillion.
- Over 100,000 traders have seen their position wrecked in the past 24 hours, with ETH taking the majority of the share of liquidations.
- The overall liquidations are close to $400 million, meaning that those related to ETH positions account for over half of all.
