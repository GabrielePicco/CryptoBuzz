Password manager says breach it disclosed in August was much worse than thought.

## Highlights

- LastPass says hackers obtained a wealth of personal information belonging to its customers.
- Hackers also copied encrypted and cryptographically hashed passwords and other data stored in customer vaults.
- The breach was disclosed in August.
- LastPass has taken steps to shore up its security following the breach, including decommissioning the hacked development and rebuilding it from scratch.
- Customers should make sure they're using the default password settings that exceed the default settings for passwords stored in their vaults, the company says.
- The threat actor could use the source code and technical information stolen from LastPass to hack a separate LastPass employee and obtain security credentials and keys for accessing storage volumes within the companyâ€™s cloud-based storage service.
