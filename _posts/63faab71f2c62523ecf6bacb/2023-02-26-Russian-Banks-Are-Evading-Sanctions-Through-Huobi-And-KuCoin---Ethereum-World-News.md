Huobi and KuCoin may be violating the sanctions imposed on Russian banks by allowing Russian users to trade crypto on their exchanges.

## Highlights

- Huobi Global and KuCoin are reportedly processing transactions tied to sanctioned Russian banks.
- Customers are able to trade on the crypto exchanges using debit issued by the sanctioned banks.
- Binance, the worldâ€™s largest crypto exchange, is reportedly offering multiple methods to Russians to convert local currency into crypto.
- This is being done through over-the-counter (OTC) trading and a peer-to-peer marketplace, both of which are available to Russians without know-your-customer (KYC) checks for up to $10,000.
- The actions of these crypto exchanges may be in violation of the sanctions imposed on Russia by multiple nations around the world.
