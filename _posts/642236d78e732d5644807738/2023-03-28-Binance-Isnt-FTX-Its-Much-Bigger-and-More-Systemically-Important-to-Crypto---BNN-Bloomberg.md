The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and Chief Executive Officer Zhao for allegedly evading federal laws and operating an illegal digital-asset exchange. Bitcoin fell as much as 4.5% after the lawsuit was filed

## Highlights

- The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and Chief Executive Officer Zhao for allegedly evading federal laws and operating an illegal digital-asset exchange.
- The CFTC is seeking permanent trading and registration bans in the enforcement action it filed as well as unspecified penalties and restitution.
- The move will reverberate across an industry that boomed outside regulated finance in a decade of low interest rates before Ponzi schemes, exchange mishaps and more helped snuff out speculative euphoria.
- Binance is the biggest target by far in a US regulatory crackdown that has engulfed other big players, from US exchange Coinbase Global Inc.
- to fallen algorithmic stablecoin king Do Kwon.
