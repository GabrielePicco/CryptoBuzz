After the \"Pepe the Frog\" creator released 46 identical NFTs, an apparent case of buyer's remorse has now led to a US$500,000 lawsuit in which the winner of the original NFT auction accuses the creator and his organization of fraudulent inducement and unlawful business acts.

## Highlights

- Halston Thayer won a US$537,084 auction for an NFT showing the controversial meme figure "Pepe the Frog", which has mostly been associated with memes from the alt-right movement in the United States.
- The winner of the original NFT auction accuses the creator and his organization of fraudulent inducement and unlawful business acts.
- Thayer has now filed a lawsuit and claims that the value of his NFT dropped significantly due to the release of the aforementioned free additional NFTs.
- However, it has to be noted that buyers do not acquire the legal copyright of their NFT's image.
- In the end, this bizarre incident and legal conflict once again underlines the intangible value and sometimes inexplicable price of non-fungible tokens.
