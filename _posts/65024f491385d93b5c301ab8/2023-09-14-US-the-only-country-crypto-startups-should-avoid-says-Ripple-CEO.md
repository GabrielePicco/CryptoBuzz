Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse says the United States has become one of the worst places in the world to open a cryptocurrency firm. But court victories to Ripple and Grayscale suggest U.S. courts now longer favor the SEC the way they used to, he says.

## Highlights

- Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says the U.S.
- is one of the worst places in the world to launch a cryptocurrency startup.
- The CEO says the SEC is engaging in a political war with the industry with its lawsuits.
- Singapore and the United Kingdom should take note from the likes of Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland by enacting policies that encourage crypto innovation while protecting consumers.
- OKX president Hong Fang said investors may not be ready for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund because much of the new blockchain-based infrastructure hasnâ€™t been battle tested by the masses.
- He said the question I have on my mind is whether our industry is actually ready for it.
