Ukraine is the fifth country in as many weeks to lay down some ground rules for the crypto market, in a sign that governments believe bitcoin is here to stay.

## Highlights

- Ukraine is the fifth country in as many weeks to lay down some ground rules for the crypto market.
- The bill was set in motion in 2020 â€“ and heads to the desk of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
- Authorities have trended toward taking a combative stance when it comes to virtual cash, regarding it as a "scam," raiding crypto-related businesses.
- If signed by the president, virtual assets, digital wallets and private keys are terms that will be enshrined in Ukrainian law.
- The new legislation also spells out certain protections against fraud for those who own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and in a first for Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada.
