Bitcoin is about to see new all-time highs in difficulty, and hash rate might follow, BTC on-chain data shows.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's hash rate and difficulty are making snap gains, data shows.
- Bitcoin hit six-week lows of under $20,000 but its network fundamentals are anything but bearish.
- Difficulty is due to increase by an estimated 6.8% next week and could jump to new all-time highs.
- Bitcoin/USD is down around 7% in a week but is not putting off miners, who have recently exited their own multi-month capitulation phase.
- The latest on-chain data shows that this will be the highest upward difficulty adjustment since January this year, according to data from BTC.com, and hash rate might follow, it says.
