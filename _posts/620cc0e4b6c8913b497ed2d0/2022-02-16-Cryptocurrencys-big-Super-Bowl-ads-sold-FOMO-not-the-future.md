Super Bowl LVI may have been the first crypto bowl. But despite the hype, none of the commercials at the big game made any attempt to actually sell people on anything other than spending more money on crypto.

## Highlights

- Super Bowl LVI may have been the first crypto bowl.
- Despite the hype, none of the ads at the big game made any attempt to actually sell people on anything other than spending more money on crypto.
- Instead, crypto’s big mainstream pitch was a flashy, celebrity-studded entryway to get new buyers into the blockchain hype wheel.
- There were no ads shilling NFT drops, no Bored Ape appearances during the halftime show, or even a mention of the NFL's commemorative NFTs for the Super Bowl.
- The commercials focused almost exclusively on exchanges and the most basic aspect of ways to more easily invest in cryptocurrency.
