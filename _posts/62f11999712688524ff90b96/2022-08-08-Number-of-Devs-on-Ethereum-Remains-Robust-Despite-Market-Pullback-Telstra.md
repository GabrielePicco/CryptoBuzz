Telstra's latest report found that the steady growth of the number of active contributors across top ecosystems has indicated the strength of Web3 community.

## Highlights

- Telstra Ventures – the investing arm of Australian telecommunication giant Telstra – released a health report on three top blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.
- With the most number of monthly active contributors, noted the Ventures, Ethereum is the “strongest and largest community” out of the three.
- The report also found that unfunded opportunities are still widely available in the ecosystems mentioned above, with venture and corporate investors only betting around half of the top 10 projects in each ecosystem.
- Since Bitcoin peaked in November, the number of active contributors has only slipped by 9% as of July this year, indicating the ongoing crypto winter has not curbed developers’ overall confidence in the network.
