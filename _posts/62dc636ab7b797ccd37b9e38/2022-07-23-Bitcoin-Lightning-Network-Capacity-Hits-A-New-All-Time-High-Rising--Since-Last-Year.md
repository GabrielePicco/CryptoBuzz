Bitcoin's Lightning Network continues to scale, with capacity hitting a new all-time high. This is according to 1ML.com’s current data findings. Read more!

## Highlights

- The Lightning Network, a “layer 2” payment protocol that enables near-instant, low-cost Bitcoin transactions, has seen its capacity reach a new all-time high.
- As of October last year, the network’s total capacity was 574.63 BTC — worth approximately $2.9 million at current prices.
- This is the highest total capacity the Lightning Network has ever reached, and it comes as the protocol continues to see increasing adoption.
- Currently, the lightning network has up to 17,680 nodes with 45,691 channels.
- The average cost of a Bitcoin transaction has dropped recently, with the rapid adoption of the network.
