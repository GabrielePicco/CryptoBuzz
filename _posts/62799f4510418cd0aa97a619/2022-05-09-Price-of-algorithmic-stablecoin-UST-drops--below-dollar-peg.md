The algorithmic stablecoin UST has fallen 2% below its peg to the US dollar, according to data from crypto exchange Binance.

## Highlights

- The algorithmic stablecoin UST briefly fell 2% below its peg to the US dollar on Monday.
- UST is a stablecoin backed through its relationship with the LUNA token.
- A burning mechanism and ability to always be able to sell $1 worth of LUNA for 1 UST are designed to keep it in check.
- Critics say the success of this operation depends on the strength of the strength on LUNA's price and on its key DeFi platform, Anchor, continuing to produce an up to 20% yield to incentivize liquidity.
- In light of such concerns, the Terra ecosystem has been stockpiling bitcoin to use as a backstop.
