A series of actions against crypto firms by the U.S. securities regulator could prove to be SEC chair Gary Gensler’s swan song after a United States Representative took issue with his handling of the industry.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Representative Warren Davidson says he will introduce legislation to fire SEC chairman Gary Gensler.
- Davidson: "To correct a long series of abuses, I am introducing legislation that removes the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and replaces the role with an Executive Director that reports to the Board" SEC commissioner Hester Peirce criticized the new proposed rule amendments in an April 14 statement, declaring “stagnation, centralization, expatriation, and extinction are the watchwords” of the latest move by the SEC.
- The SEC has been expanding its reach to solve problems “that do not exist” rather than create clear regulations.
