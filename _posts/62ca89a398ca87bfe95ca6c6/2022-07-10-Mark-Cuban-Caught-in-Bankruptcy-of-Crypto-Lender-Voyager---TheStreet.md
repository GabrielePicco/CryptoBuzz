Successful entrepreneur and star of the Shark Tank tv show is a crypto investor but one of his bets just backfired.

## Highlights

- Mark Cuban is facing a torrent of criticism over a partnership with a crypto firm.
- Cuban signed an agreement linking his NBA team, the Dallas Mavericks, to the crypto lender Voyager Digital last October.
- Cuban: "Weâ€™re going to come up with new ways to introduce Mavs fans to cryptocurrency and help them understand it" The firm is one of the collateral victims of the crisis of confidence wiping out more than $2 trillion from the crypto market since all-time highs were set in November.
- Voyager Digital is a cryptocurrency trading platform also offers loans and staking services, which are a kind of rewards for holding certain coins.
- Faced with this disaster, Voyager suspended deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards on its platform.
