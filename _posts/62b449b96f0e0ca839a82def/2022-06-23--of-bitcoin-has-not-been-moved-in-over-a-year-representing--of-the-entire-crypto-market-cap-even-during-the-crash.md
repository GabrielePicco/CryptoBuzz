1yr HODL Wave live chart shows the percentage of all bitcoins that have not been moved from one wallet to another for at least 1 year.

## Highlights

- 1yr HODL Wave shows percentage of all bitcoins that have not been moved from one wallet to another for at least 1 year.
- This is a good example of blockchain analysis as we are looking at blockchain data to identify when bitcoins were last sent.
- The proportion of 1yr+ coins decreases as price climbs up towards a new cycle high.
- This is, in part, due to people who have been holding onto coins for over 1 year deciding to cash in some profit, so they sell the coins and those coins are no longer classified in this analysis as 1yr+.
- Therefore the proportion of coins that have been held over the past year drops as price (blue line) increases.
