Bitcoin recaptures $30,000 in the midst of a tumultuous market where many experts are uncertain as to where Bitcoin will travel next.

## Highlights

- Robert Kiyosaki, author of the personal finance book ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad, took to Twitter on May 12 to discuss his thought on the current situation in the crypto market.
- He views the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and also values it for its decentralized properties.
- Bitcoin has just recaptured $30,000 in the midst of a tumultuous market where many experts are uncertain as to where Bitcoin will travel next.
- The finance author said he is ready to wait to purchase the dip around $17,000, which is where he expects Bitcoin to bottom after originally crashing to $20,000.
- In January, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author had said he would buy more Bitcoin “if and when BTC tests $20K”
