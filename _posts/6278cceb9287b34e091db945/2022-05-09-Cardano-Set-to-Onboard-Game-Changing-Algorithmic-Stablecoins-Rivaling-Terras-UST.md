The concept of algorithmic stablecoins has recently created quite a buzz in the crypto space with Terra's UST at the center of many chatters.

## Highlights

- Algorithmic stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a real-world commodity or fiat currency but backed and stabilized by other cryptocurrencies.
- The two blockchains join the likes of Terra and Tron in choosing not to back their cryptocurrencies with fiat reserves.
- The concept of algorithmic stable coins has recently created quite a buzz in the crypto space with Terraâ€™s UST at the center of many chatters.
- The argument for this new model is that it creates a better-decentralized system that eliminates the risks that come with a stablecoin having a centralized issuer and operator.
- It appears that the model has gained adherents amongst crypto architects.
