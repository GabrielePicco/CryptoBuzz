The usage of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies was in doubt following the draft of the European Union's (EU) proposed legal framework.

## Highlights

- The European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs voted against a ban on Proof-of-Work mechanisms underlying popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- The provision that could have forced PoW cryptocurrencies to shift to more environmentally friendly mechanisms failed to get the votes required in the parliament.
- PoW is the consensus mechanism underlying the digital assets that require a lot of energy to operate.
- An earlier draft of the MiCA framework featured a clear and unequivocal section that advocated a restriction on crypto services that relied on ecologically unsustainable consensus techniques beginning in January 2025, with the prohibition taking effect immediately.
- However, the clause was eventually repealed as a result of widespread opposition from the sector.
