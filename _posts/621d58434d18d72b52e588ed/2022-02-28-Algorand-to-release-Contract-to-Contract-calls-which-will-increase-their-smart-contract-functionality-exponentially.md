In recent months, Algorand’s smart contract functionalities have steadily matured, enabling developers to build powerful and versatile dapps (decentralized applications). The latest development is…

## Highlights

- Algorand’s smart contract functionalities have matured, enabling developers to build powerful and versatile dapps (decentralized applications) The latest development is the ability for one smart contract to call another smart contract.
- Previously, smart contracts could only be called by a user initiating an application call transaction.
- Now, a contract can simply call another one directly, rather than calling contract A directly, we can now create our own contract that calls contract A and asserts that what we expect to happen does, happen, happen.
- Users can call Alice's smart contracts to swap their ALGO for USDC and vice versa.
- They can use them to swap USDC for ALGO or ALGO.
