From Sam Bankman-Fried to Bitboy, cryptocurrency fans have been too quick to support divas who gained notoriety on social media. It's a phenomenon that needs to end.

## Highlights

- Many of the centralized cryptocurrency platforms that collapsed this year had something in common: a young, outspoken and cocky leader.
- But each time, misplaced trust in their abilities resulted in disastrous consequences.
- If crypto wants to avoid similar catastrophes in the future, it’s time for us to rearrange our leadership priorities.
- We need to end the cults of personality and use this recognition to avoid future disasters.
- The crypto community needs to focus on building a more experienced, less experienced leader, and building products that use web primitives to solve problems better than anything we’ve experienced before.
- And we need to stop listening to the quietest voices in the room, even if they are sometimes quieter.
