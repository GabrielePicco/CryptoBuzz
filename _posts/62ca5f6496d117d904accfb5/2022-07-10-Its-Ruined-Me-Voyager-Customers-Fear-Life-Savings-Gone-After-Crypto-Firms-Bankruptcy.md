Voyager customers are struggling with depression and fearing the worst after the crypto brokerage suspended withdrawals and declared bankruptcy. “I was dumb enough to trust them,” one said

## Highlights

- U.S.
- crypto brokerage and lender Voyager announced this week that it had voluntarily entered the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.
- Voyager had been struggling to recoup more than $650 million it loaned to the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, which went bankrupt after it made a series of risky and overleveraged crypto bets.
- The company had portrayed itself as a responsible elder amid a sea of crypto madness that could nevertheless promise up to 12 percent in annual rewards.
- Customers now say that they feel they were repeatedly “misled” and duped by the company.
- Voyager declined to discuss the experiences of the company’s customers.
