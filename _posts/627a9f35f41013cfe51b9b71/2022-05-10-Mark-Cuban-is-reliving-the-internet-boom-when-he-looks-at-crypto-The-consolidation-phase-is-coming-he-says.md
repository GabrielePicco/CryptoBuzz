Billionaire investor Mark Cuban thinks “crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” and he sees what’s likely to happen next.

## Highlights

- Mark Cuban made his fortune in the Web1 ’90s when he founded Broadcast.com.
- He now mostly invests in the crypto space, with an extensive portfolio of blockchain-related companies.
- Cuban says there will be a ‘consolidation phase next,” where copycat blockchains will die out.
- He sees the biggest opportunity in how companies use smart contracts, or collections of code that execute a set of instructions on the blockchain, to gain a competitive advantage, Cuban tweeted.
- He compared this to the dotcom boom in the 2000s, when internet startups launched copycat products and promising returns, before the bubble burst.
