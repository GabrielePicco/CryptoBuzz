The crypto market has been witnessing a drawdown for the past month, and the past 24 hours have added to the same. As FUD surrounding Solana and the F

## Highlights

- The crypto market has been witnessing a drawdown for the past month and the past 24 hours have added to the same.
- Large trading firms have deposited over $30 million worth of Bitcoin, ETH and Arbitrum on exchanges.
- The last 24 hours also marked a milestone in the Futures market, where long contracts were liquidated as a result of the crash.
- The present value of the crypto market was this low back in March this year and marks a six-month low.
- The value of all cryptocurrencies is now below the $1 trillion mark for the first time in six months.
- This three-week high marks losses for investors that would take some time to recover, looking at the current bearish sentiment.
