South Korean crypto exchanges have joined Switzerland in targeting Russian account holders by blocking Russian Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

## Highlights

- South Korean crypto exchanges have joined Switzerland in targeting Russian account holders by blocking Russian Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
- Singapore and Switzerland have followed suit with crypto sanctions against Russian users.
- Binance CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has allayed fears that the Kremlin could use the cryptocurrency to dodge sanctions, claiming that “crypto is too small for Russia.” Binance, Coinbase, FTX, and Kraken have so far taken a hard line against blanket restrictions on Russian users, with Kraken CEO Jesse Powell saying that a legal basis would be required to block all Russian users from accessing crypto on Kraken.
- The Japanese are considering suspending transactions with Russia.
