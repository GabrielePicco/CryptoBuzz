We already knew that crypto developers cannot always be trusted. But can we trust the data?

## Highlights

- CoinDesk reporters Danny Nelson and Tracy Wang released a bombshell report that could tarnish the reputation of the Solana ecosystem.
- At the center of the story is a network of 11 developers who collaborated on a complex web of decentralized finance (DeFi) services based around a Solana stablecoin exchange called Saber.
- The developers, with names including Surya Khosla, Larry Jarry, 0xGhostchain and Goki Rajesh, succeeded in creating trading and staking services that attracted a claimed $7.5 billion in deposits.
- The Macalinaos were able to bolster the reputations of their various identities simply by orchestrating fake Twitter conversations and having them trade endorsements.
