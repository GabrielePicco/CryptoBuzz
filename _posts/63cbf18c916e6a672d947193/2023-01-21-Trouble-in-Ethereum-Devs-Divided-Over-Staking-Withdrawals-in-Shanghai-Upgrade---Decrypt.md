Some Ethereum core devs have expressed concern that Shanghai is launching too quickly for fear of public pressure over staking withdrawals.

## Highlights

- Developers are concerned about how and when they will implement a new proof-of-stake upgrade to the network.
- The upgrade will give users a way to get back the $25 billion worth of ETH pledged to the Ethereum network.
- But a minority of the network’s core developers have voiced concerns that the upgrade is being rolled out too quickly, out of fear of public reprisal, at the expense of technical costs that could have lasting impact on the network, they say.
- Developers are most reluctant to switch ETH withdrawals over to the new encoding method in the upgrade following Shanghai, which is being called “Cancun.”
