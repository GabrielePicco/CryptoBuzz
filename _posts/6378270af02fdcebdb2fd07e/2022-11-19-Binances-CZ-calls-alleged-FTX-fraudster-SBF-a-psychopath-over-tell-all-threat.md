Changpeng Zhao, who suspects FTX of leaking information that endangered his children, had set in motion the events that sank FTX last week and wiped out all of his rival's wealth.

## Highlights

- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao accuses Sam Bankman-Fried of being a dangerous lunatic for threatening to air information potentially damaging to the billionaire exchange co-founder known as CZ.
- Zhao has previously said he suspected FTXâ€™s collapsed empire was responsible for leaks that endangered his children.
- FTX collapsed last week and wiped out all of his rival's wealth, and he may be facing jail time.
- Zhao responded to a question from a moderator at an investment summit sponsored by the Milken Institute on Thursday.
- The fallout has sparked contagion across the industry, sparking a liquidity crisis at crypto lender Genesis Global Capital, a unit of Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group.
