Critics say the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain cryptocurrency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US

## Highlights

- Montana coal plant was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers.
- But a bitcoin mining company stepped in to resurrect it.
- Hardin is part of a wave of America’s ‘zombie’ fossil fuel plants that have been brought back from the dead by cryptocurrency companies looking to feed the insatiable energy demands of their mining operations.
- Critics point out that enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain the virtual currency fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US.
- Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, thousands of bitcoin mining computers have been packed in shipping containers alongside the Scrubgrass plant, which burns waste coal and was set to close.
