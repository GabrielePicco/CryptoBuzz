Google Cloud is adding support for the Solana blockchain in BigQuery; it will go live at the start of next year.

## Highlights

- Google Cloud is adding support for the Solana blockchain in BigQuery.
- Support for the network will go live in Q1 2023, says web3 lead Nalin Mittal.
- This comes nine years after it first added Bitcoin to the service.
- This was its first web3 product, Mittal said, noting its launch was when Google Cloud “really deepened our investment in this space” It is already running a Solana validator to learn more about the blockchain by doing this and working out how to run one in a cost-efficient way.
- This experience is helping Google Cloud prepare to add the network to its service for offering managed blockchain nodes.
