FTX previously asked for the money to be returned in December; donor recipients now have until the end of February to return funds.

## Highlights

- FTX employees donated a total of $90 million to political causes, including Nancy Pelosi and John Fetterman.
- The bankrupt crypto exchange previously asked for the money to be returned in December.
- Now, they're sending letters to politicians calling for it to be sent back by February 28.
- The debtors are trying to claim that back to reimburse customers, according to FTX's lawyers.
- Just five of the 196 politicians who received the money from FTX said they had successfully returned it in January, but it's unclear at the time of publication if any recipients have returned any of the funds.
- FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including campaign finance violations.
