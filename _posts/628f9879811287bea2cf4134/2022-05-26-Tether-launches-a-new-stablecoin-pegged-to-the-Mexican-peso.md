Tether has launched a new Mexican peso-pegged stablecoin, marking its entrance into the Latin American market.

## Highlights

- Tether has launched a new Mexican peso-pegged stablecoin, dubbed MXNT.
- The stablecoin will be available on the Ethereum, Tron and Polygon blockchains.
- This is Tether's fourth stablecoin after US dollar-pegging USDT, Euro and Yuan Tether.
- The launch of MXNT will provide a testing ground for onboarding new users in Latin America and pave the way for more stablecoins in the region, Tether says.
- USDT remains the biggest stablecoin in the world, with its current total supply standing at over 77 billion.
- Over the past month, however, the supply of USDT has declined by more than 15 billion
