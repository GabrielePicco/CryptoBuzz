The CFTC would replace the SEC as crypto's prime regulator under a major new bill proposed by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand.

## Highlights

- The bill would end the SEC's jurisdiction over much of the crypto market.
- It would grant authority over many tokens to another agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
- The bill stands almost no chance of passing in the current Congress.
- It is expected to gain new momentum in 2023 following the November mid-term elections, and to frame the contours of future crypto policy.
- It also proposes a new approach to regulating stablecoins, a hot button issue of late, after the collapse of a stablecoin project called Terra in May wiped out tens of billions of dollars.
- It calls for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct studies on crypto's impact on climate change.
