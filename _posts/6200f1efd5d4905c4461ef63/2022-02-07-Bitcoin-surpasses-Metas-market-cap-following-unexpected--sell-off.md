Bitcoin has unexpectedly overtaken Meta in market cap following a vicious sell-off in shares that saw the value of Facebook's parent company fall by 25%.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin has unexpectedly overtaken Meta in market cap following a sell-off in shares that saw the value of Facebookâ€™s parent company drop more than 25%.
- The stock sell off, prompted by a disappointing Q4 earnings report, saw the biggest wipeout in market history from Meta, setting the stage for Bitcoin to jump in and enter the coveted top 10 companies valued by their market capitalisation.
- Bitcoin currently sits at just below $37,000 despite a number of bullish catalysts including MicroStrategy purchasing a further 600 Bitcoin for $25m and increased adoption and acceptance across both legacy and mainstream markets.
- However, for Meta, the misery continued as it saw user numbers decline alongside posting a $10bn loss in its metaverse business
