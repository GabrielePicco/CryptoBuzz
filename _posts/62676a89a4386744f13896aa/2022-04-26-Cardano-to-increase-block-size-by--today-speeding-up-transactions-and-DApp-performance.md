In addition to its upcoming Vasil hardfork, Cardano (ADA) is hard at work trying to increase the network’s performance even further.

## Highlights

- Cardano (ADA) is increasing the blockchain’s mainnet block size by 10% or 8KB.
- The current block size is 80KB and the update will increase it by an additional block size of 8KB to 88KB.
- This increase will dramatically enhance the network, further increasing its throughput and performance of decentralized apps (DApps) built on top of it.
- After the deployment of the update, the team plans to monitor the network performance for at least five days (one epoch) to determine the next increase.
- Meanwhile, the native cryptocurrency, ADA, has been trading in the red recently, with the price dropping 2.91% over 24 hours and 3.81% across the week.
