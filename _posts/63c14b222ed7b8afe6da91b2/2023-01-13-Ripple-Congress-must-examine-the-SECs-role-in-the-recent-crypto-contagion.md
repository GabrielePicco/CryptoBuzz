For the last two years, Ripple has been arguing that the SEC is overreaching on crypto regulation. It's time for the new Congress to provide certainty.

## Highlights

- BlockFi and FTX have filed for bankruptcy and are tangled up with scandal-ridden FTX.
- Stu Alderoty: Congress has the authority–and responsibility to oversee the SEC.
- He says the SEC does not have free reign to make new laws and it doesn't have the jurisdiction over crypto.
- Ripple's general counsel: The SEC can only exercise the authority expressly granted to it by Congress.
- This limbo is pushing consumers to offshore platforms that operate with no U.S.
- oversight.
