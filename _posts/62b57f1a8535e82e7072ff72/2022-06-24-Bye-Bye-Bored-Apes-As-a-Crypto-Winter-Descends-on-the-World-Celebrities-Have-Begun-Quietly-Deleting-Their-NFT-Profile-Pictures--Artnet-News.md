Jimmy Fallon, Shonda Rhimes, Travis Barker, and Meek Mill are among the celebrities who have foregone their NFT avatars.

## Highlights

- The relationship between NFT community and A-list celebrities has been a befuddling one for most.
- As the art world tries to reconcile what its relationship to the crypto-space is, so are celebrities, and both Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon have changed their Twitter profile photos from the Bored Ape Yacht Club.
- Many celebrities have abandoned their non-fungible avatars, including Serena Williams, Reese Witherspoon, Travis Barker, and Meek Mill.
- Thereâ€™s an added sense of irony in the timing as the NFT NYC convention is currently going on near Times Square, just around the corner from his stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
