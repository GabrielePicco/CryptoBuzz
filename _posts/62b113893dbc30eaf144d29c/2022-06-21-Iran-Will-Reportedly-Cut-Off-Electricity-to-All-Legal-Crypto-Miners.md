With the upcoming summer, Iranian authorities have decided to halt crypto mining in the country... again.

## Highlights

- Iranian authorities will stop providing electricity to all 118 licensed mining operators starting from June 22.
- Authorities justified their decision with the growing demand for electricity during the summer.
- Iran’s temporary ban last year was lifted at the end of September, but there's no information about the country’�s plans for 2022.
- Iran's share in terms of BTC mining has been declining, so shutting down all licensed operations in the nation will not have much of an impact on the hash rate.
- For example, Iran accounted for 6.9% of the total hash rate in June last year, while the percentage has dropped significantly to 0.2% as of January 2022.
