Canada's Ontario Securities Commission has flagged tweets from two cryptocurrency exchange leaders, according to The Logic.

## Highlights

- Canada's Ontario Securities Commission has apparently reported tweets from two cryptocurrency exchange CEOs to law enforcement.
- Those tweets are from the CEOs of both Coinbase and Kraken, who criticized Canada's Emergencies Act after it was invoked last week.
- The act allows Canada to blacklist crypto addresses with ties to the Freedom Convoy protests.
- Both CEOs urged investors not to hold their cryptocurrency in custodial exchange wallets, rather send funds from a non-custodial off-exchange wallet.
- One expert suggested that those tweets are poor optics and that the messages within could cause Canadian regulators to “closely monitor these exchanges” and attract “undue attention”
