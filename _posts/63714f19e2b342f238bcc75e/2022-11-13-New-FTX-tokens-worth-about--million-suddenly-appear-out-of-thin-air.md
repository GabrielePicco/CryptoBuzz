Crypto exchange FTX has seen 192 million FTX tokens sent from its contract deployer to a newly created crypto address.

## Highlights

- 192 million FTX Exchange tokens mysteriously printed 192 million new tokens today.
- The total value of these tokens at current prices is about $380 million.
- The number of freshly created tokens eclipsed FTTâ€™s prior circulating supply, which was about 133 million.
- FTX came under pressure following a leaked portion of its sister firm's balance sheet that showed the large majority of its assets were denominated in FTT tokens.
- The FTT token played a crucial role in the problems that reportedly led to the insolvency of FTX and trading firm Alameda.
- This triggered a bank run from clients last week, which led to a high-profile implosion of the exchange.
