The £22m crypto-currency gang bought cars for people they met in the pub during the 'staggering' scam

## Highlights

- Four criminals at the centre of the £22m conspiracy have been sentenced.
- They worked with ringleader James Parker, who masterminded the scam from his Blackpool home.
- The scam made so much money that £5,000 gift cards were handed out to people in the street and cars were bought for people they met in the pub.
- The gang exploited a loophole to siphon off more than £20m from Parker's trading account on an Australian-based cryptocurrency exchange.
- His corrupt financial adviser Stephen Boys, nicknamed 'Rodney' after the character in Only Fools and Horses, helped launder the stolen funds.
- He was jailed for six years and Kelly Caton, 45, jailed for four-and-a-half years.
