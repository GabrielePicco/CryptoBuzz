Core developers allegedly warned Do Kwon about setting Anchor’s interest rates at 20% in the week before launch, but we all saw the outcome of that.

## Highlights

- Anchor Protocol was originally designed to offer an interest rate of 3.6%, but this was dialed up to 20% just a week before release to attract more investors.
- Core developers allegedly warned Terra Luna founder Do Kwon about setting Anchor’s interest rates at 20% in the week before launch.
- South Korean authorities also reportedly issued subpoenas to employees of Terraform Labs, looking into whether there was intentional price manipulation and whether the tokens went through proper listing procedures.
- Despite this, the Terra co-founder has managed to relaunch the collapsed network on May 28 with a new chain called Terra 2.0, also known as Pheonix-1.
