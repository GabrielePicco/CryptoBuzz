Earlier this week, all eight of the indicators in Glassnode's popular \"Recovering from a Bitcoin Bear\" dashboard flashed green for the first time in nearly two years, a massive bullish BTC signal.

## Highlights

- Eight key on-chain and technical indicators tracked by Glassnode’s “Recovering from a Bitcoin Bear” dashboard just signaled that the next Bitcoin bull market might be here.
- This was the first time that all eight indicators had been flashing a BTC buy signal in unison since March 2016.
- On Thursday, one of the indicators (the 2-year Z-score of the Revenue From Fees Multiple) reserved slightly and was no longer flashing a buy signal.
- However, this reversal will likely be short-lived and all 8 indicators are likely to soon start flashing green in unison once again.
- The last time this happened was during October 2020, when Bitcoin was trading around $11,500.
