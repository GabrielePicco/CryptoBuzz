MicroStrategy could avoid being forced to sell its bitcoin at a lower price than it bought it if the company adds more collateral to its loan.

## Highlights

- MicroStrategy said it would face a margin call on some of its bitcoin holdings if the price of bitcoin falls to $21,000.
- The software company's total bitcoin holdings are now worth more than $5 billion and have an average cost basis of about $30,700.
- CEO Michael Saylor said he doesn't plan to ever sell his bitcoin stash.
- The company's stock price is down 62% since bitcoin topped out in November, and is down 37% year-to-date.
- It is trading at a market valuation of only $4.4 billion, meaning the stock is trading in a discount to its underlying crypto holdings.
