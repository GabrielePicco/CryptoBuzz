FTX’s collapse has been “incredibly damaging” for the cryptocurrency industry according to the APAC policy director for Ripple, Rahul Advani.

## Highlights

- Ripple’s APAC policy director Rahul Advani said the collapse of FTX has been “incredibly damaging” for the crypto space.
- He said the industry will need forward-looking and “flexible” regulations to boost confidence in the crypto sector while protecting consumers.
- Advani argued that a “one size fits all” approach to regulation “will not work” due to differing risk profiles presented by crypto companies.
- He added that risks posed by crypto businesses include requirements on conduct, like segregating business accounts, disclosing conflicts of interest and providing “retail investor safeguards” The Australian government is doubling down on its commitment to a crypto regulatory framework.
