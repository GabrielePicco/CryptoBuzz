The Warriors had a $10 million sponsorship deal with FTX, which assured fans it was a \"leading, safe and secure\" platform to buy NFTs.

## Highlights

- The Golden State Warriors named FTX as an "official cryptocurrency platform" last December.
- A former FTX customer is now suing the organization in California after FTX's collapse.
- Elliott Lam, a Canadian who lives in Hong Kong, filed the proposed class-action lawsuit in San Francisco.
- The lawsuit alleges that FTX used "A-list celebrities and mass branding campaigns" in order to "drive unwitting investors and consumers into a Ponzi-like scheme" The lawsuit seeks $5 million in damages for non-US customers, adding that "thousands, if not millions, of consumers internationally" have been impacted by the collapse of FTX.
