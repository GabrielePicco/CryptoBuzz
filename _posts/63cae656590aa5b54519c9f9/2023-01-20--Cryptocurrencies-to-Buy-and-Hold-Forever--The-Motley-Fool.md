The future is bright for these cryptocurrencies.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC 1.41%) is the oldest cryptocurrency, which means it has the longest history of recovering from downturns.
- Bitcoin is down close to 70% from its high in late 2021, but it's still up more than 30,000% since 2013.
- Some experts have big expectations for the crypto, with some predicting it could reach $100,000 per token or more in the coming years.
- Bitcoin and Ethereum won't be the right investments for everyone, but they have some of the most potential of any cryptocurrencies right now, so there's still reason to be optimistic about their futures.
- Back in 2018, though, it fell by more than 80% over the course of the year.
