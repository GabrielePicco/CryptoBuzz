Covering the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ill-conceived enforcement action against San Francisco-based blockchain

## Highlights

- Ripple on Friday filed a supplemental letter in the U.S.
- District Court supporting its motion in the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC.
- The firm argued that the SEC failed to provide “fair notice” prior to bringing its enforcement action.
- Ripple has asked presiding judge Analisa Torres to consider the Supreme Court decision at the time of ruling whether Ripple, along with its current and former CEOs Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, respectively, broke the law by raising over $1.3 billion after selling the XRP cryptocurrency as unregistered securities.
- Judge Torres is expected to make her decision on the lawsuit any time now, but it can extend to two months.
