Following the collapse of Terra, the crypto sector has arrived at a pivotal juncture, while uncertainty persists.

## Highlights

- The overall value of the global cryptocurrency market cap was $2.2 trillion on January 1, 2022, but as of the time this article was published on May 20, it was at $1.29 trillion, representing a decline of 41.36% since the beginning of the year.
- The Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) has fallen to a level that is its lowest since the index’s inception nearly two years ago.
- Meanwhile, the flagship digital asset Bitcoin has bounced back above $30,000 after crashing to an 18-month price low over the weekend.
- The decline prompted experts to sound the alarm that another “crypto winter” akin to the one that occurred in 2018 may be on the horizon.
