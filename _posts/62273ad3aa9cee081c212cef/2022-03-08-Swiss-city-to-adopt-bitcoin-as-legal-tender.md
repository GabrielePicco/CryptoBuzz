Lugano will allow people to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrency

## Highlights

- Swiss city of Lugano will allow people to pay for goods and services using bitcoin, Tether and its own LVGA Points token.
- Mayor Michele Foletti said it would also serve as a “beacon for green financing” by using environmentally-friendly methods to power bitcoin mining.
- The introduction of bitcoin as a legal form of tender follows a similar move last year by El Salvador, which became the first – and still the only – country in the world to officially adopt bitcoin as an official currency.
- The move follows several municipalities in Switzerland where it is possible to pay taxes using cryptocurrency in several municipalities using the token in recent years.
