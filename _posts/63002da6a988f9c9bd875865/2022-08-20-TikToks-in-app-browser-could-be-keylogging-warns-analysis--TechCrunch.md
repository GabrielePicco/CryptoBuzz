Developer Felix Krause found TikTok's iOS app injecting code that could enable it to monitor all keyboard inputs and taps. Aka, keylogging.

## Highlights

- TikTok's iOS app injecting code that could enable it to monitor keystrokes on third party sites rendered inside the app's in-app browser.
- TikTok says it does not collect keystroke or text inputs through this code, which is solely used for ‘troubleshooting’ and ‘performance monitoring’ The social network says code is used to ‘stop listening’ to prevent an application capturing user data.
- InAppBrowser.com lets mobile app users get details of code that’s being injected by apps by listing JavaScript commands executed by the app as it renders the page.
- A TikTok spokesperson says the JavaScript code does not mean our app is doing anything malicious.
