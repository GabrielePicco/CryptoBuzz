Nayib Bukele has spent another $1 million in Bitcoin, adding 80 BTC to El Salvador’s existing stash of 2,301 BTC.

## Highlights

- Nayib Bukele has spent another $1.5 million to buy 80 BTC at $19,000 per coin, adding 80 BTC to El Salvador's Bitcoin stash of 2,301 BTC.
- The Central American politician tweeted that El Salvador’s Bitcoin stash was worth $43,719 million, implying losses for the country of about $60.2 million.
- The president shared screenshots of several Bitcoin buy orders being executed at exactly the price of Bitcoin on the day of the latest buy.
- This suggests the president uses a centralized exchange for his trades, not an OTC (OTC) desk, which would be a more logical choice for high-profile trades.
