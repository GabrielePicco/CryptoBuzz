One community member pointed out some inconsistencies, as the IMF acknowledged that El Salvador’s GDP is projected to grow above the historical average.

## Highlights

- International Monetary Fund suggested El Salvador reconsider its plans to increase exposure to Bitcoin.
- The community responded to the IMF’s suggestion with various messages calling out the organization.
- One community member argued that the move is a way to “scare other countries away” from the example that El Salvador has set.
- Another argued that this is a strong Bitcoin bull signal, calling it a case of spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt, or “FUD.’ The community member believes that Bitcoin will march on regardless of the IMF's suggestion, as it continues to strengthen its position amid an ever-inflating fiat economy.
- On Feb.
- 14, Bitcoin's average block size hit a new all-time high.
