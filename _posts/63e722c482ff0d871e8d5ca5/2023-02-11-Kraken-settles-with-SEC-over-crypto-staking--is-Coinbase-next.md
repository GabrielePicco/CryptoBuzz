Kraken agrees to pay $30 million and discontinue offering staking-as-a-service in settlement with the SEC.

## Highlights

- Kraken agrees to pay $30 million and discontinue offering staking-as-a-service in US.
- The move is part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
- Kraken neither admits nor denies the allegations of the SEC.
- However, the SEC chairman has previously suggested that staking products could be a security.
- This effort seems to be part of an effort to broaden its enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
- At the end of the settlement, assets enrolled in the on-chain staking program by US clients will automatically be unstaked and will no longer earn staking rewards, a spokesperson told Protos.
