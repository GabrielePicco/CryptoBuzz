Texas governor Greg Abbott begged crypto miners to halt operations in the event the Texas grid shuts down completely like in February 2021.

## Highlights

- Texas governor Greg Abbott wants to make sure his state’s power grid doesn’t embarrassingly fail again.
- Governor Greg Abbot held a meeting with dozens of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and influencers last October.
- Abbot asked those in attendance to shut down their mining operations in the event the Texas grid shuts down completely like in February 2021.
- Two Bitcoin miners have reportedly volunteered to shut their operations in order to conserve energy for homes and other businesses, so who knows?
- It could work out, but it's not like Abbott has much of a choice, as he faces an upcoming tough election challenge from both his own party and the Democrats who are sure to attack his weakness on Texas’ electric infrastructure.
