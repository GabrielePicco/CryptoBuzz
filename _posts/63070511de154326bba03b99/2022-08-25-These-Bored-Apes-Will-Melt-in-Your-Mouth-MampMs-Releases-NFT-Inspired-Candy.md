A licensing deal between Mars and music label UMG means Bored Ape NFT images are now printed on M&M’s chocolate candies.

## Highlights

- Mars has signed a deal with music label 10:22PM to create limited edition M&M’s based on Kingship.
- The candies feature images of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Kingship avatars.
- Kingship was revealed last November as a virtual band created by investor Jimmy “j1mmy” McNelis.
- NFT is a token that acts like a deed of ownership to a virtual item, and can be used for things like profile pictures, artwork, and collectibles.
- Bored Apes have also been used for fast food restaurants, marijuana and alcohol packaging, clothing, collectibles, and more.
