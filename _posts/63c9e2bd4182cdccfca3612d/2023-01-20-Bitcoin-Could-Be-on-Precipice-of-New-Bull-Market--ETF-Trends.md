Some crypto market observers believe bitcoin’s impressive 2023 start could be the start of a new, potentially lengthy bull market.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin retreated on Wednesday, but that one-day retreat doesn’t alter the fact that the largest cryptocurrency by market is hot to start 2023.
- Some crypto market observers believe bitcoin’s impressive 2023 start could be the start of a new, potentially lengthy bull market.
- Should that scenario materialize, it could lift equity-based, crypto-correlated exchange traded funds, including the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) BLKC has 57 holdings, and to varying degrees, a significant portion of the fund's roster qualifies as crypto-related.
- Some BLKC components, including bitcoin miners, are so battered that even modest upside for the digital currency could boost the ETF.
