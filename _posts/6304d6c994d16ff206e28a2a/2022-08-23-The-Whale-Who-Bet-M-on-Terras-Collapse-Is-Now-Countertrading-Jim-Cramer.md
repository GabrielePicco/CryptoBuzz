- Algod says they have doubled the size of a trading account that solely bets against Cramer's calls.
- “Countertrading” refers to a practice in the crypto space in which traders bet against another market participant's calls, often because they believe that the participant is likely to make a wrong call.
- Cramer has become a running joke in the space thanks to a number of questionable calls on where the market could move in recent months.
- Al god became known for betting $1 million on Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon that LUNA would fail to hold its trading price over a one-year timeframe in March.
