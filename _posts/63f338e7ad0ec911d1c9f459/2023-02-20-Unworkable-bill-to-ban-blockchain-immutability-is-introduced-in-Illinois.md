An Illinois senator has introduced a bill that would force crypto node operators, miners, and validators to reverse transactions if required to do so by the court — even though that’s an “impossible” task.

## Highlights

- A recently introduced Illinois Senate Bill has been ridiculed by the crypto community over its “unworkable” plans to force miners and validators to do “impossible things” — such as reversing transactions if ordered to do so by a state court.
- Florida-based lawyer Drew Hinkes described the bill as “the most unworkable state law” related to blockchain and cryptocurrency that he has ever seen.
- The Senate Bill was quietly introduced into the Illinois legislature on Feb.
- 9 by Illinois Senator Robert Peters, but appears to have been only recently noticed by the community after a tweet.
- The bill would essentially try to ban immutability on.
