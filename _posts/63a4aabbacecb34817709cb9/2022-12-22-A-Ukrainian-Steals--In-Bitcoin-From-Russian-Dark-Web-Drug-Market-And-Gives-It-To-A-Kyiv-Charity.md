Solaris drug market’s master wallet has been hacked and its funds diverted to a Ukrainian humanitarian charity.

## Highlights

- Ukrainian cyber intelligence expert Alex Holden is giving back to his homeland.
- Hold Security has hacked into one of Russia’s largest online drug markets, dubbed Solaris.
- He diverted funds to a Ukrainian humanitarian charity, Enjoying Life, which provides humanitarian aid across Ukraine.
- Holden is now sitting on a substantial cache of information on Solaris’ users and operations, which he believes could be used to identify the whereabouts of any Russian cybercriminals who’re using the site to fuel their operations.
- Killnet first offered to take down websites for a fee by flooding them with traffic.
- But after Russia invaded Ukraine, Killnet became a patriotic mercenary hacking crew, promising to target Ukrainians and their supporters.
