Nexo, one of the world's biggest crypto lenders, has been quietly battling with co-founder Georgi Shulev for control over millions in digital assets.

## Highlights

- Georgi Shulev, a former banker who co-founded Nexo, was fired in September 2019.
- Nexo transferred 1,451 bitcoins to an account with a co-founder's name on it, a new court ruling says.
- The decision comes at a tough time for the crypto sector as digital asset values have plummeted and some companies have been eyeing bankruptcy.
- A Nexo representative told Insider that the company was grateful for the ruling and insisted that Nexo was a "safety-first lender" The judge on July 1 ordered Shulv to continue transferring the money to Nexo but said he could hold onto an amount equal to what Nexo had agreed to pay him.
