As cryptocurrency donations continue to pour in, the Ukrainian government is being transparent on how it is using the funds.

## Highlights

- Digital Transformation Ministry formed two years ago to upgrade the country’s information-technology industry and provide high-speed internet access.
- Most of the money donated came from Bitcoin and Ether, while smaller amounts came in the form of stablecoin Tether, Polkadot ($5.8M), Solana, and even from NFTs, including one CryptoPunk worth over $200K and the Julian Assange Nfts created by multidisciplinary artist Pak worth $1.86M.
- As cryptocurrency donations continue to pour in, the Ukrainian government is being transparent on how it is using the funds.
- “This info environment is as hostile as it gets, exercise extreme vigilance”
