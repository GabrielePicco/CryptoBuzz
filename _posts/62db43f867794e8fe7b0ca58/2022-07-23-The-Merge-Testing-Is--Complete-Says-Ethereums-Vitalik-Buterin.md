Ethereum's co-founder said the blockchain project is amid a lengthy process that will ultimately make it more robust in many ways.

## Highlights

- The Merge is 90% complete and needs to be tested only on Ropsten, says Buterin.
- He said the project is amid a lengthy process that will ultimately make it more robust in many ways.
- Another phase will focus on increasing the network’s scalability for rollups through sharding.
- The Surge will boost the network's scalability to process 100,000 transactions per second, he said.
- The surge will be a significant improvement from the current 15-20 transactions a second, says the head of the Ethereum project.
- It is expected to be completed in September this year, with the switch from PoW to PoS expected to take place later this year.
