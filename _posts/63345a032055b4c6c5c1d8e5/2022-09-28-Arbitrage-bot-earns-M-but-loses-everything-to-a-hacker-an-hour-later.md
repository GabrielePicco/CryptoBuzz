A bot with the prefix 0xbadc0de was exploited, draining its balance of 1,101 Ether, around $1.4 million at the time of publication.

## Highlights

- A bot with the prefix 0xbadc0de was able to earn 800 Ether, around $1 million, through arbitrage trades.
- An hour later, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the bot’s “bad code” and tricked it into authorizing a transaction that drained its balance of 1,101 ETH.
- The bug can be traced back to the bot's callback routine, and this was exploited by the hacker to approve an arbitrary address for spending.
- A vulnerability in Profanity, an Ethereum vanity address generator, was exploited, draining $3.3 million in funds from various wallets.
- The DEX warned users that their wallets were at risk and urged them to transfer their assets.
