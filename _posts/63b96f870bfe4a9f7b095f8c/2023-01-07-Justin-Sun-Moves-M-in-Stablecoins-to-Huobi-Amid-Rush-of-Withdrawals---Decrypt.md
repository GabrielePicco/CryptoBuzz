Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun today transferred about $100 million worth of his own stablecoins to his crypto exchange Huobi Global.

## Highlights

- Tron founder Justin Sun today moved $100 million of his stablecoins to his crypto exchange Huobi after news dropped that it was cutting staff.
- The money was in the form of USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT) Sun confirmed to Bloomberg that he moved the “personal funds” because it “shows the confidence to Huobi exchange.” Nansen’s Martin Lee said on Twitter that the transfer “might be to help with the increased withdrawals or maintain a level of confidence in the exchange,” Sun and his team have repeatedly said people are spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) around the exchange.
