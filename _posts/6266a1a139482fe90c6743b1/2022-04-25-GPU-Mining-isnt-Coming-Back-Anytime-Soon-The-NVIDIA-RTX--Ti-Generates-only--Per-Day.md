Cryptomining is at an all-time high but there is very little chance of GPU mining making a comeback. An RTX 3080 Ti generates just over $2 a day which means you’ll be needing nearly 2 years to

## Highlights

- There have been reports from multiple outlets stating that GPU mining might make a comeback.
- However, there is very little chance of GPU mining making a comeback.
- For example, an RTX 3080 Ti (LHR) generates just over $2 a day which means you’ll be needing nearly 2 years to just break even, that is if you manage to buy a card at MSRP.
- Chances are that new graphics cards will come with anti-mining measures as well, further discouraging GPU mining.
- Overall, it looks like cryptomining won’t be making a comeback anytime soon.
- The Ethereum mining difficulty is at an all-time high.
