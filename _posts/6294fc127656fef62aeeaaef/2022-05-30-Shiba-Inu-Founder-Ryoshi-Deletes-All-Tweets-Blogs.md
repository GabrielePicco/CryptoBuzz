Shiba Inu token founder Ryoshi deletes all his tweets and blogs and almost disappears on all formats of social media today...

## Highlights

- Shiba Inu token founder Ryoshi has deleted all his previous tweets and blogs and changed his profile picture.
- Ryoshi had tweeted his last during May last year and has mostly stayed away from posting.
- The only thing significant is the timing- All of this happened exactly a year after his last tweet and last blog.
- It is not known if a scammer has broken into Ryoshiâ€™s Twitter handle and Medium blogs and deleted everything.
- The token is down 46.7% in the last 30-trading days and 86.3% from its all-time high of $0.00008616 which it reached in October last year.
