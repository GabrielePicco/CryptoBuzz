As meme coin promoter Musk turns his attention from crypto to AI, Dogecoin appears to bearing the brunt of this week's losses.

## Highlights

- The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is down another 1.7% over the day and almost 10% on the week, dropping to a two-month low of $0.073.
- The world’s largest meme coin last traded at these levels on January 8 amid the resurging crypto market.
- Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted last Friday that he is now turning his attention to artificial intelligence.
- Morgan Creek Capital Management chief investment officer Mark Yusko ranted that meme coins don’t have any value.
- Despite the latest slump, DOGE today managed to flip Polygon (MATIC) in rankings, becoming the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
