This beginning of 2022 has been marked by insistent rumors about the imminence of a clearer regulation regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies by the Joe Biden administration. This is not the first…

## Highlights

- The Fed released a report in mid-January 2022 on the advisability of creating a digital dollar.
- Domenico Tiepolo says such a digital currency issued by the Fed will not be a threat to Bitcoin, but rather a Trojan horse pushed by the U.S.
- Fed will only act if there is support from the general public and the government.
- Tieppolo: A digital dollar could be important for America to maintain its monetary hegemony in a future world where everything will be digital.
- Bitcoin combines three properties never before seen in a human invention: decentralized, digital, and rare.
- It is only a matter of time that the American dollar’s shortcomings will ultimately be an extension of the digital world, he says.
