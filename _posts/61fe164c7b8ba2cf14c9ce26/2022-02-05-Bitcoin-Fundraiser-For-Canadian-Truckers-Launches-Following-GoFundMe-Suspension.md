A group of entrepreneurs and bitcoin advocates has launched a fundraising campaign for Canadian truckers protesting against vaccine mandates.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin Fundraiser For Canadian Truckers Launches Following GoFundMe Suspension.
- GoFoundMe has suspended campaign collecting funds for Canadian truckers protesting against covid-19 restrictions.
- Group is spearheaded by Canadian entrepreneurs and bitcoin advocates Jeff Booth, Greg Foss, Benjamin Perrin as well as Twitter user NobodyCaribou.
- All the bitcoin being raised will be custodied in a wallet with multiple signatures required to spend the bitcoin.
- This eliminates a single point of failure and ensures that the group has to coordinate how the funds are used.
- The group is in discussions about how to best distribute the funds to the truckers.
