The move was small enough to be explained away as legitimate but big enough to set the community on edge.

## Highlights

- Aptos is a relatively new blockchain environment touted as a “Solana-killer’s” blockchain.
- The project allegedly promises free mints, with only the gas fees necessary for the mint to be paid.
- However, the wallet connected to the project was reportedly being drained to the tune of $12 million.
- The move was small enough to be explained away as legitimate but big enough to set the community on edge.
- The event serves as a reminder to the community at large to be on the lookout for fishy projects like Harmony, Phantom, and others can become the victims of bad actors, so can over-eager investors.
