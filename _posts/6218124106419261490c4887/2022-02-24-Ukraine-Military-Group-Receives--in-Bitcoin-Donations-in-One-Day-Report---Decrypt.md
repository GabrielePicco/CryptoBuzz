Bitcoin donations to the NGO Come Back Alive \"suddenly shot up\" right around the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to Elliptic.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin donations to pro-military groups in Ukraine "suddenly shot up" right around the Russian invasion of Ukraine, analytics firm Elliptic says.
- In 2021, about $570,000 in Bitcoin donations went to pro military groups.
- On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, euphemistically calling the invasion a "special military operation" Ukrainian organizations adopted crowdfunding tactics back in 2014, when Russia-aligned President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from office during the Maidan Revolution.
- Peer-to-peer crypto transactions can bypass banks, financial institutions, and even government controls, though to be most useful, they may occasionally need to be exchanged for cash.
