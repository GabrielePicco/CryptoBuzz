Crypto exchange KuCoin has drawn criticism for APRs of up to 253% on Ethereum, Bitcoin and Tether deposits in dual investment contracts.

## Highlights

- KuCoin Earn page boasts APRs of 233.15% on ETH, 253.28% on Bitcoin, and 100% on Tether deposits.
- Company's website says that the Tether (USDT) rates are part of a promotion, but the ETH and BTC rates listed correspond with an advanced “dual investment” product.
- That has raised some eyebrows on Crypto Twitter, along with defenders who have dismissed the criticism as FUD.
- 24-hour volumes on the exchange, which was $640 million yesterday, up to $862 million today, making it the fifth largest centralized exchange by normalized volume, according to CoinGecko.
