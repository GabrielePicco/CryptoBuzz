This might be a defining case for the NFT market. In an interesting turn of events, it seems Yuga Labs has decided to sue Ryder Ripps. Ripps is a long-time critic of the Yuga Labs, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) known for some of the world's most popular NFT collections. Ripps has long criticized the founders as Nazis and scam artists, but recently decided to take it a step further.

## Highlights

- Ryder Ripps is a long-time critic of the Yuga Labs, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) known for some of the world's most popular NFT collections.
- The artist made a complete copy-cat collection of Bored Apes then proceeded to sell them.
- In fact, the “fake” collection had sales volume than the ACTUAL Bored ape collection at one point.
- As one would expect, the company didn’t take too kindly to this and has since sued the artist for trademark infringement and a host of other claims.
- It’s unclear if BAYC has any intellectual property rights in any of their collections because the NFTs are AI-generated images.
