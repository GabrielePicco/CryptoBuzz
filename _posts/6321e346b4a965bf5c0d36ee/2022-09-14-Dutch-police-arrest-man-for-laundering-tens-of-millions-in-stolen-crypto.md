The Dutch police arrested a 39-year-old man on suspicions of laundering tens of millions of euros worth of cryptocurrency stolen in phishing attacks.

## Highlights

- The Dutch police arrested a 39-year-old man on suspicion of laundering money laundering.
- The suspect was released on September 8, 2022, but remains a suspect as the police continue their investigation.
- Law enforcement was able to track down the suspect by following crypto stolen using a malicious software update for the Electrum wallet.
- Police seized devices and “data carriers” to aid the ongoing investigations.
- The expected profit that the man made from money laundering was seized in cryptocurrency by the police, so the police confiscated digital assets too.
- The suspect allegedly took the funds to Bisq, a decentralized peer-to-peer exchange network that enables users to trade between various cryptocurrencies without requiring registration or KYC details.
