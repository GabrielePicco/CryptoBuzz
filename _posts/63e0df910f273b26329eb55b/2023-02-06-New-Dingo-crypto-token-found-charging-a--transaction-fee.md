Researchers at IT security company Check Point security have flagged Dingo Token as a potential scam after finding a function that allows the project's owner to manipulate trading fees up to 99% of the transaction value.

## Highlights

- IT security company Check Point security has flagged Dingo Token as a potential scam after finding a function that allows the project's owner to manipulate trading fees up to 99% of the transaction value.
- The warning comes after company researchers have already witnessed this malicious fee change 47 times.
- Check Point says that in one case they observed, a user spent $26.89 to purchase 427 million Dingo Tokens but instead received 4.27 million, which is exactly 1%.
- The project's website doesn't contain much information about the owner, and the published "tokenomics" white paper only mentions a 10% (5% + 5%) transaction fee.
