Gensler’s failures hurting investors, says Rep. Tom Emmer, noting that the SEC chair last appeared before congress last October.

## Highlights

- Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer called out Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler on Sunday.
- Emmer says the SEC had failed to gather the information needed from crypto companies that would have prevented disasters like the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
- He also claimed that the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which he co-chairs, has received reports of SEC inquiries and investigations that warrant concern.
- In March, Emmer raised concerns about the SEC’s interactions with crypto companies with an “overburdensome” approach to regulating the industry, but said at the time that the agency was stifling innovation with an overburdening approach.
