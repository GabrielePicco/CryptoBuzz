Crypto.com announced Tuesday it is now a Visa Associate Program Member in Singapore. The move will allow the crypto exchange to self-issue a crypto exchange's Visa card, enabling users to use it for everyday purchases and earn rewards in CR

## Highlights

- Crypto.com announced Tuesday it is now a Visa Associate Program Member in Singapore.
- The move will allow the crypto exchange to self-issue a Crypto.com Visa card, enabling users to use it for everyday purchases and earn rewards in CRO coins.
- Singapore is one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions on the globe, even though the city-state tightened crypto regulations following the LUNA implosion in May 2022, which tipped numerous firms to liquidation.
- After the company begins self-issuing Visa Cards, customers in Singapore “can expect further exciting payment features and digital services to be introduced over time,” said the company.
- The company already offers Visa Cards in the US, Canada, and multiple countries across Europe and the Asia Pacific.
