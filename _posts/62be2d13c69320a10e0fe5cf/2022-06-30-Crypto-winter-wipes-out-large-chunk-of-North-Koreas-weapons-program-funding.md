Back in 2018, a Singapore-based US citizen and member of the Ethereum Foundation advised North Korea on how to use cryptocurrencies to work around US sanctions. Now...

## Highlights

- North Korea has been using stolen cryptocurrencies to fund its nuclear missile program.
- Recent drop in value of major cryptocurrencies has wiped out a large chunk of stolen funds.
- North Korea relies heavily on stolen digital tokens for its weapons development and testing activities, a recent UN report says.
- This week, analytics firm Chainalysis said old North Korean crypto holdings it has been monitoring are now worth an estimated $65 million.
- The funds were obtained from at least 49 state-sponsored hacks performed between 2017 and 2021, and they likely represent only a small amount of the total that has yet to be laundered.
- When pressed for comment, country representatives at its London embassy dismissed the report as "totally fake news"
