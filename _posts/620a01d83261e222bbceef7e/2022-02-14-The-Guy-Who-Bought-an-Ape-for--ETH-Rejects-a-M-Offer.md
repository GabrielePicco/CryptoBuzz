Someone paid 4 ETH for a bored ape NFT and less than a year later turned down a whopping $1.2 million offer. Here's his story.

## Highlights

- Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that depict bored apes.
- Each NFT is composed of various traits, and each one of them is provably rare.
- The rarer a trait is represented by the rarity of each trait, so the rarer the ape is.
- At the time of this writing, the only gold fur ape listed for sale below 1K ETH is ape #1837.
- The user paid 4 ETH for a bored ape NFT back on May 1st â€“ the first full day after the collection was sold out.
- He turned down a 420 ETH offer for the above ape back in May 2021 and is worth $1.2 million.
