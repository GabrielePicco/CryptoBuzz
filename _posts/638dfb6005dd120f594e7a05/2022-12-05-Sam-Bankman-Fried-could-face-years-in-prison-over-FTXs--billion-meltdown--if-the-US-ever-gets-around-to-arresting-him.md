FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried remains in the Bahamas, even as regulators are rumored to be building a case against him. Why isn't he in jail yet?

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange that was worth $32 billion a few weeks ago, has spun a new narrative – one in which he was simply an inexperienced and novice businessman who was out of his depth.
- At least $8 billion in customer funds are missing, reportedly used to backstop billions in losses at Alameda Research, the hedge fund he also founded.
- Both of his companies are now bankrupt with billions of dollars worth of debt on the books.
- It is quite the departure from the image he had carefully cultivated since launching his first crypto firm in 2017 – and it recalls a classic legal defense dubbed the "bad businessman strategy"
