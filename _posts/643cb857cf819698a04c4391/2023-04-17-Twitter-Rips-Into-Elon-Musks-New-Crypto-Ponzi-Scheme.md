Elon Musk is moving forward with introducing stock and crypto trading options on the app — and its denizens are calling bull.

## Highlights

- Twitter is partnering with social trading company eToro to introduce stock and crypto trading options on the social network.
- The move could be seen as a last-ditch effort to stop the site from hemorrhaging money.
- Users are worried that by allowing users to directly trade crypto on the platform, Musk could invite in even more of these scams.
- "Oh you said you wanted them to *fix* the crypto spam?"
- journalist Jacob Silverman quipped.
- "That's cute," another user quipped.
