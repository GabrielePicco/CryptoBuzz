Indira Kempis, senator for Nuevo León in Mexico, wants to follow El Salvador by making bitcoin (BTC) legal tender and is drafting a law. Find out why…

## Highlights

- Senator for Nuevo León in Mexico wants to follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and make bitcoin legal tender in Mexico.
- El Salvador became the first nation in the world to make BTC legal tender on 7 September 2021.
- Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has previously said he has no intention of making bitcoin (BTC) legal tender.
- But Kempis believes the country will “promote an innovative commitment to close inequality gaps, for inclusion and financial justice” by implementing a BTC law in Mexico, she said.
- The law will be based on El Salvador's current law, where businesses will be required to accept BTC if their customers request the option.
