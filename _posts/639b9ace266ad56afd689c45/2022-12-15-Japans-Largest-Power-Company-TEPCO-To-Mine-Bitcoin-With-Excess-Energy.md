TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess energy.

## Highlights

- TEPCO is Japan's largest electric power company and is partnering with a semiconductor company to mine bitcoin with excess energy.
- The company is seeking ways to monetize surplus power with bitcoin mining through its wholly-owned subsidiary Agile Energy X. A pilot project has already been set up on the premises of the Tokyo office in the Tokyo metropolitan area.
- The utility behind the Fukushima nuclear reactor in 2011 was struck by an earthquake and huge tsunami that knocked out some of its cooling systems, allowing three reactors to melt down, and later admitted that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent such disasters.
- The power company is joining major global energy companies in jumping on the bitcoin mining bandwagon.
