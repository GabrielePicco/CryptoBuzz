Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin believes the Metaverse \"is going to happen,\" but he doesn't think corporations will successfully build it.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin says he doubts any “existing corporate attempts” to create a Metaverse will succeed.
- The next-generation Internet is widely used to refer to a virtual world in which users will be able to work, play, and connect with others within immersive virtual worlds.
- Facebook's Metaverse arm, Reality Labs, announced last year that it would sink $10 billion into the space in 2021, and it later reported a $2.8 billion loss in its second-quarter earnings report this week.
- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has indicated he is ready to double down on the Metaverse and has said he's ready to expand on the space.
