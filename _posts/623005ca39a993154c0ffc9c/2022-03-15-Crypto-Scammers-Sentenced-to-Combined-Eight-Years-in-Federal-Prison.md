This Dallas crypto scam reached far and wide. Now, the people who started it are going to prison.

## Highlights

- Bruce Bise and Samuel Mendez pleaded guilty to tax evasion.
- They admitted to raising around $24 million from more than 13,000 investors.
- They used that money on personal expenses like casino trips, cars, art and rent.
- The two also reached a civil settlement with the Securities & Exchange Commission and the company agreed to pay $8.3 million to resolve claims that their company defrauded investors and operated an unregistered digital asset exchange.
- The owners used the company’s income for their own purposes at their shareholders’ expense, the Justice Department said in a press release that the two also paid over $1,740,000 collectively as part of the settlement.
