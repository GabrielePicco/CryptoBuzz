A group of Cardano (ADA) developers demonstrated the smart contracts for this network that are written in a \"simple pythonic programming language.\"New type of smart contracts introduced to Cardano (ADA): Python usage in Web3 acceleratesThe team of Cardano (ADA) developers that goes by @ImperatorLan…

## Highlights

- A group of Cardano (ADA) developers demonstrated the smart contracts for this network that are written in a "simple pythonic programming language" Eopsin allows developers to compile a 100% valid Python 3 code into Cardano's smart contracts assembly.
- The project is still in its infancy, and many more tests are yet to be organized in order to evaluate their effectiveness and developer friendliness.
- The contracts I tested are cheaper/faster than pure Plutus code (about factor 10).
- But the sample code is really tiny and does not tell much about the power of the compiler.
- The contract was deployed yesterday, on Jan.
- 10, 2023, on preprod testnet.
