## Highlights

- The Department of Justice has requested an independent examiner be appointed to review FTX's collapse.
- It could be one way for the DOJ to gather evidence of alleged fraud.
- FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange's collapse has rocked the wider crypto world.
- Bankruptcy trustee Andrew Vara said there's a substantial basis to believe that Bankman-Fried and other managers mismanaged FTX or engaged in fraudulent conduct.
- Vara: "It just shows a level of interest and attention that they're paying to this that should be troubling to Mr.
- Bankman Fried" FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
