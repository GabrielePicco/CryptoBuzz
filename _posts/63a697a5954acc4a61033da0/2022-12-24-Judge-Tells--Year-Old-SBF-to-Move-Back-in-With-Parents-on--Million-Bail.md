Failed crypto founder Sam Bankman-Fried heard the news no young man wants to hear Thursday: “sorry son, you’re moving back in with your parents.” For all the young people who lived with their folks into their 20s, let’s just hope for his sake that the old man didn’t get rid of his old childhood bed.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond on Thursday.
- The bail was secured thanks to a deal between prosecutors and the FTX ex-CEO’s legal team that finally got him to agree to extradition.
- FTX co-founder will also need to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, go in for mandatory mental health counseling, and limit his movements to the Northern District of California.
- He has been charged with eight counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, money laundering, and violating campaign finance laws.
- The charges equate to a max of 115 years in prison, but that total is a bit of a stretch especially noting other recent major fraud convictions.
