Some residents of Lebanon have started looking for alternative financial tools, specifically stablecoins, due to the economic knockdown of the country.

## Highlights

- Lebanese government closed all local banks earlier this week due to ongoing risks for employees and customers.
- It remains unknown when the financial institutions will re-open, which might be one reason why locals started looking for alternative financial instruments, including digital assets.
- The Lebanese government has not yet put the digital asset sector under its supervision.
- However, the lack of regulations does not seem to be a problem for domestic investors, most of whom do not trust the actions of the ruling body.
- The current inflation rate in Lebanon is over 160%, while the recently closed banks only intensified the issue.
- Up to 14 million Lebanese people live outside their homeland (two times more than the population of Lebanon itself)
