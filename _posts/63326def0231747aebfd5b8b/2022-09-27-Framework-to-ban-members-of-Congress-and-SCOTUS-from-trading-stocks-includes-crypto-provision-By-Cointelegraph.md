Framework to ban members of Congress and SCOTUS from trading stocks includes crypto provision

## Highlights

- Framework to ban members of Congress and SCOTUS from trading stocks includes crypto provision.
- Members of the United States House of Representatives and Senate as well as Supreme Court justices currently trading cryptocurrencies may have to stop hodling while in office should they get enough votes.
- The bill, if passed according to the framework, would suggest a change in policy following the 2012 passage of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, allowing members of the Congress to buy, sell and trade stocks and other investments while they are in office but also requiring them to disclose such transactions.
- If passed, the bill would change the policy of trading stocks and investments in the U.S.
