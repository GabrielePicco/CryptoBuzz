Vitalik Buterin has explained why the Ethereum network is not likely to increase its speed much in spite of planned upgrades.

## Highlights

- Vitalik Buterin has expressed the view that the Ethereum blockchain is unlikely to get much faster, in spite of planned upgrades.
- He explained that reducing block time was constrained by the necessary tradeoff with “safety and decentralization” Reducing block times would cause many signatures to be excluded from the blockchain, and “highly centralized actors” would be in increasingly favorable positions to reap disproportionate rewards.
- Other prominent cryptocurrency founders and developers have joined the discussion on Twitter, including Dogecoin's Emi̇n Gün Si̇rer and the founder of Ava Labs, who developed Avalanche, also weighed in.
