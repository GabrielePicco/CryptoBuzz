Changpeng Zhao, Binance's CEO and founder, described France as \"very progressive\" in adopting crypto.

## Highlights

- Binance is now listed as a registered digital asset service provider by the French stock market watchdog AMF.
- The move makes France the first major European nation to give Binance the greenlight.
- The company handles spot trading volumes of more than $14 billion and nearly $50 billion in derivatives volume in a single day.
- Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao gave a keynote at a Paris crypto industry event in April 2022 to debut a new accelerator program for so-called "Web3" start-ups.
- The firm is now seeking to make peace with regulators after a backlash last year from authorities in numerous countries including the U.K., Italy and Singapore.
