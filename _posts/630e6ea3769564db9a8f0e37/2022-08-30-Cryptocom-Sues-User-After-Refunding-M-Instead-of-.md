Crypto.com reportedly didn't realise it had sent $10 million to one of its users by mistake for seven months. They bought a mansion.

## Highlights

- Two sisters in Melbourne reportedly used the erroneous $10 million to buy a luxurious mansion.
- A judge has now reportedly ordered the property be sold and the funds returned to Crypto.com.
- The blunder happened because an account number was entered in the payment field, instead of the initially requested amount, Daily Mail reported.
- The woman sought a $100 refund from the exchange in May last year, but received $10m.
- By the time the exchange realized what happened, the money had already gone towards a multi-million dollar mansion in the Melbourne suburb of Craigieburn, complete with a home cinema and gym.
- The fiasco echoes a similar event that took place around the same time last year.
