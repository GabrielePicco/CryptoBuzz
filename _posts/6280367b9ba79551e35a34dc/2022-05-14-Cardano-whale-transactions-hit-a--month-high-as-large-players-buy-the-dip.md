It appears that large-scale investors, also known as whales, have taken advantage of the falling market with Cardano.

## Highlights

- Large-scale investors, also known as whales, have taken advantage of the falling market with Cardano (ADA) It appears that Cardano whales were the most active they had been since January, when the ADA price bottomed out at $0.40 on May 12.
- A spike in whale purchases has commonly indicated the largest price shifts for the DeFi asset in the past.
- The Vasil hardfork is scheduled for June with the intention of expanding the protocol and significantly increasing its transaction throughput, volume, and liquidity, as historical data indicates that the price of ADA often increases prior to a hardfork.
- Currently, Cardano is trading atÂ $0.545, up 19.26% in the last 24 hours and down 30.53% across the last week.
