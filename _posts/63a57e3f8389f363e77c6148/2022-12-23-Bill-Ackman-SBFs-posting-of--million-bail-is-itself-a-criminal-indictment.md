Billionaire hedge-fund manager fires off a tweet but apparently misses a key detail about how FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried posted bail.

## Highlights

- Pershing Square Capital Management CEO Bill Ackman says Sam Bankman-Fried posted bail of $250 million.
- Ackman tweeted that the FTX founder may be guilty of fraud charges.
- He said in a tweet that the bail amount suggests that he may be at risk of trusting a crook.
- But a judge released the ex-FTX founder on bail in the form of a personal recognizance bond secured by equity in his parents’ house and by their signatures, as well as the signatures of two other financially responsible people.
- The latest statement marks a turn toward more severe criticism of the founder, who is also known as SBF.
