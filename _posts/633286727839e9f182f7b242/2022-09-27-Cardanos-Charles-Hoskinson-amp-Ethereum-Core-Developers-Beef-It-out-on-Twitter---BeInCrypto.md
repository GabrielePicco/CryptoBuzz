Ethereum core devs and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson duke it out on Twitter following Hoskinson's criticism of Ethereum.

## Highlights

- Former co-founder Charles Hoskinson said the Merge was only needed because it was inherently flawed.
- Hoskinson also said that the Ouroboros protocol is a peer-reviewed consensus protocol that the Cardano blockchain uses.
- He said it is time for people of rival blockchain communities to “grow up” and be able to candidly discuss protocol design differences instead of criticizing a project like Cardano as being “a cult beholden to an evil, sociopathic, but incompetent pathological lying founder who somehow has stumbled upon stolen success, but will be in jail any moment now when the world wakes up.
- Hoskinson: It’s time to grow up.
