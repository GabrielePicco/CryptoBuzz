@VivekVentures: The Merge has been part of the Ethereum roadmap for 6+ years: a community-wide effort telegraphed from the early days Yet now, less than 8 weeks away from mainnet Merge, a wave of doubt is...…

## Highlights

- Forks provide the community the ability to choose; forks represent a right to underlying freedom.
- The ability to fork is a *fundamental right* for a blockchain's community.
- The Merge has been part of the ETH roadmap for 6+ years: a community-wide effort telegraphed from the early days.
- Yet, less than 8 weeks away from mainnet Merge, a wave of doubt is rising focused on a hostile PoW fork.
- There is $65bn of USDT and $55bn of USDC on ETH today.
- In a chain split, this amount would double.
