The chief engineer of FTX, who had not been charged previously, is reportedly in talks with U.S. authorities to reduce a potential sentence.

## Highlights

- Nishad Singh, the former chief engineer of FTX Group, is in talks with the SDNY Attorneyâ€™s Office.
- He is reportedly in talks to reduce a potential prison sentence.
- Singh funded Democratic candidates to the tune of $8 million in the last election cycle alone.
- Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang have pleaded guilty to fraud, but the accusations of money laundering via donations to political campaigns have not made much headway in court.
- It's possible that Singh's tentative cooperation with U.S.
- authorities would be centered around that side of the court case, since he was reportedly a big-league philanthropist and donor himself.
