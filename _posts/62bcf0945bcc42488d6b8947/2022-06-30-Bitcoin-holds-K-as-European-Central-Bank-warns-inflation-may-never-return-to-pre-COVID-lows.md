Inflation could be permanently higher, says the ECB as Bitcoin and BTC price action stay muted.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin (BTC) held steady at just above $20,000 after the June 29 Wall Street open.
- Europe's chief banker admitted the world would "never" return to low inflation.
- In Europe, head of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde appeared to state that inflation would remain high indefinitely.
- The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, also sounded similarly downbeat on the prognosis.
- Meanwhile, MicroStrategy upped its Bitcoin corporate treasury with a fresh 480 BTC purchase, a move lauded by commentators.
- On-chain analytics resource Material Indicators eyed a breakout now due "very soon" as the monthly candle was all but doomed to disappoint.
