Despite the recent boost, Solana is down almost 20% over the past month as many SOL-based projects migrate to pastures new.

## Highlights

- The price of embattled cryptocurrency Solana has shot up by over 11% over the past 24 hours.
- The New Year price bump has seen the cryptocurrency reclaim $11 after several days trading below double-digits.
- Solana is down nearly 20% in the past month and has lost over 95% of its value since reaching an all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021.
- Several large-scale projects have announced plans to abandon the Solana ecosystem in recent months as many Solana-based projects migrate to other networks, including Polygon and DeGods.
- Buterin tweeted last week that “smart people” have told him there is an “earnest smart developer community in Solana”
