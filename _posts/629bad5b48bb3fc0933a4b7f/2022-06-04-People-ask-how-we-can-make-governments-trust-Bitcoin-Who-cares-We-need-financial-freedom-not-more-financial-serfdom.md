Listen now | Read now to learn whether governments have any place at all within the Bitcoin blockchain

## Highlights

- Bitcoin's most important feature is its resistance to interference and control.
- Powerful governments, corporations, and individuals are completely powerless when it comes to bending the Bitcoin blockchain to their will.
- Governments have everything to gain by accepting Bitcoin, at least in terms of granting financial freedom to their constituents.
- Many potential Bitcoin users are staying on the fence until their government gives them the green light to participate in Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin will continue to operate with or without the blessing of the worldâ€™s governments, says Alex Treisman.
- Treisman: Bitcoin will move forward, block after block, no matter what you, I or the most powerful governments in the world think or do.
