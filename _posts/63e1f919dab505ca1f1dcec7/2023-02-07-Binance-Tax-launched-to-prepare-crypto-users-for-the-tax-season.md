The current version of Binance Tax is available to Binance .com users in France and Canada, with more regions to be added in the future.

## Highlights

- Binance is launching a tax reporting tool to help users stay on track of their crypto transactions for tax reporting purposes.
- Binance Tax is currently in a pilot phase in France and Canada before extending to other global markets in the Binance ecosystem later in the year.
- The company said this comes as a response to a growing number of inquiries from users about their tax liabilities.
- This comes one month after Binance announced its participation in an association to address compliance with global sanctions.
- In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced that it plans to tighten up rules for the crypto industry with a focus on investor protection in Thailand and the Netherlands.
