The richest wallet on the Ethereum (ETH) network increased in value by almost a billion dollars over the past 30 days on the back of strong ETH rallies.

## Highlights

- The richest wallet on the ETH network increased in value by almost a billion dollars over the past 30 days on the back of strong ETH rallies.
- The whale known as Naruto went from a balance of just over $1.98 billion on July 15th to more than $2.96 billion at time of writing, a nearly 50% increase.
- The deep-pocketed investorâ€™s success is mostly due to simply holding ETH during the recent rally, as Etherscan reveals that there have been no significant deposits into the wallet during the past seven months.
- The leading smart contract platform briefly surpassed $2,000 twice on Sunday, a level not seen since mid-May of this year.
