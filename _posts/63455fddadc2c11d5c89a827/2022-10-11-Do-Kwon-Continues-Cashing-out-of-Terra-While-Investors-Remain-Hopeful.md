Crypto researcher FatManTerra reports that Do Kwon been cashing out Terra (LUNA) to a Binance wallet while shilling the new coin on Twitter.

## Highlights

- On-chain records suggest Terraform Labs CEO and co-founder Do Kwon has been cashing out Terra (LUNA) to a Binance wallet while shilling the new coin on Twitter.
- Kwonâ€™s transfer activities were first revealed by cryptocurrency and finance researcher FatManTerra, who has been updating the Twitter community on developments following the crash of the TerraUSD stablecoin in May 2022.
- The findings have come to light even as the TFL CEO has been actively promoting developments on the Terra 2.0 blockchain since it launched on May 27, 2022.
- At the time of the crash, LUNC was worth a fraction of a penny.
