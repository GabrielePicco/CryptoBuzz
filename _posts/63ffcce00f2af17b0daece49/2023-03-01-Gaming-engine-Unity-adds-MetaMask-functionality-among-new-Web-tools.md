Video game development platform Unity announced a new “decentralization” category in its asset store, bringing multiple Web3 solutions to its user base.

## Highlights

- Unity’s video game development platform has added a slew of crypto platforms to its asset store.
- The “Decentralization” category includes “vetted” crypto platforms for developers interested in merging decentralization into their projects.Crypto wallet provider MetaMask was one of the 13 platforms featured on the store, with its software development kit (SDK) added to the store.
- Developers will be able to connect their MetaMask wallet to “any game developed on Unity” to use web3-enabled features within the game itself.
- The integrations will allow developers to modify the �models of ownership” in games and enable players to create, earn or acquire in-game resources, which can be subsequently traded.
