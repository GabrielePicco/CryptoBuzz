The token was once touted as an \"Ethereum killer,\" but in 2022 it has crashed 94% amid the FTX scandal and crypto winter.

## Highlights

- Solana dropped 7% Wednesday to hover around $10, far below its all-time high of $259.99 reached in November 2021.
- The token was heavily backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, and his companies held large positions on their books.
- The disgraced crypto founder said over the summer that Solana was the most underrated cryptocurrency, but the token is now down 94% for the year after crashing 70% since the collapse of FTX in November.
- On Monday, CoinDesk reported that two of the Solana blockchain's top NFT collections, DeGods and Y00ts, will migrate to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively.
