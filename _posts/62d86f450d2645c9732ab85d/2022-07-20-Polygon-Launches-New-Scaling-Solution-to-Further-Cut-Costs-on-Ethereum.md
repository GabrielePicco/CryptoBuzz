Polygon zkEVM is Polygon’s Ethereum-compatible zero-knowledge scaling solution that aims to outpace Visa's transaction throughput.

## Highlights

- Polygon zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) is said to be the "first" Ethereum-compatible scaling solution that uses the cryptographic method called zero-knowledge proofs.
- Polygon's key promises include a significant reduction of current layer-1 Ethereum network costs, as well as a dramatic increase in throughput capability, all while inheriting the security of the Ethereum blockchain.
- The team is working towards increasing [throughput] to approximately 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), which would be on par with Visa's 1,700 transactions a second.
- The mainnet launch is slated for early 2023 and the roadmap includes further improvements on throughput.
