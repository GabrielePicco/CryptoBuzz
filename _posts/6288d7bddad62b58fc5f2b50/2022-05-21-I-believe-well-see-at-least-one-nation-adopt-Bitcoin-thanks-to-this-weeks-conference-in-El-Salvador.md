Read now to learn why nations will continue to flock to the Bitcoin standard in order to help their citizens find financial freedom and stability.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin is a powerful tool that allows people to achieve the total financial self-sovereignty that many have dreamed about for decades.
- Bitcoin has been around for over thirteen years and its group of adherents has grown from a limited number of cypherpunks on an obscure mailing list to tens of millions of users around the world.
- Bitcoin is all about enabling each user to make their own choices, good or bad, basically.
- The Bitcoin blockchain is open to all and the community behind it actively rejects interference from any gatekeeper.
- And that’s how money and finance should be: free from the biases of any one party at the expense of another.
