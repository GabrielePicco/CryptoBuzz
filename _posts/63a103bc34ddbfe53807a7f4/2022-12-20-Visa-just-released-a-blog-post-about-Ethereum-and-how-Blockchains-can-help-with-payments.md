This technical paper, written by Visa's crypto research and engineering teams, is aimed at companies interested in exploring programmable payments and money.

## Highlights

- Visa's Crypto Hackathon challenge is aimed at exploring programmable payments.
- The challenge was part of Visaâ€™s internal Crypto Hackathathon challenge earlier this year.
- The example described is a common everyday use case that can be solved by existing means today such as cheque or Automated Clearing House.
- But as we are looking to utilize blockchain technology for payments, this takes a new turn when it comes to building out the solution through smart contracts.
- Auto payments are an example of pull and push payments, but don't natively support them natively.
- This paper, written by research and engineering teams, is written by Visa's crypto teams.
