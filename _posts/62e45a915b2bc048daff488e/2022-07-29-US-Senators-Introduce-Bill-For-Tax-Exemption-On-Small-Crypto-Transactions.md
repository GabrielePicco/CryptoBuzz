The bill would provide tax exemption on bitcoin transactions for less than $50 or trades netting a gain of less than $50.

## Highlights

- The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act seeks to provide tax exemption for transactions up to $50 or trades which net a capital gain of less than $50.
- Senator Patrick Toomey (R-PA) and democratic Senator Krysten Sinema (D-AZ) will introduce the bill today.
- Multiple attempts have been presented in an effort to ease tax requirements for those looking to transact in or invest small amounts of money into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
- The IRS recognizes that “it operates like ‘real’ currency,” but the IRS does not recognize that bitcoin is strictly an investment vehicle, even though the IRS recognizes.
