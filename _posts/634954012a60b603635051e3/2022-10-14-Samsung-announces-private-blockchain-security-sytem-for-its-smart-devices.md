Applications that rely on safety are among those beginning to make use of blockchain tech as its potential applications continue to expand.

## Highlights

- Samsung announced on October 13 the implementation of a “private blockchain” style security system for its smart devices.
- The purpose of the system, which has been given the name Knox Matrix, is to enhance the safety of an environment that contains several devices by having each smart device monitor the activity of the others and share access data in order to make the process of logging in more enhanced through “multi-layered mutual monitoring.” The technology was introduced as a revision of the company’s existing security strategy at the most recent Samsung Developer Conference Samsung although the firm did not elaborate much more on the inner workings of this system.
