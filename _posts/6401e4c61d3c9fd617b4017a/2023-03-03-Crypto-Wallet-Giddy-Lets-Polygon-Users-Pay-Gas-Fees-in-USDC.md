“Autogas will support even more tokens in the future,” the CEO of the wallet company said.

## Highlights

- Polygon’s sidechain still requires gas payment in MATIC, just as the Ethereum network needs ether.
- The new feature called “autogas” doesn’t actually eliminate MATIC from the equation.
- But it does take the onus for sourcing that MATIC away from the end-user.
- “Autogas will support even more tokens in the future,” the CEO of the wallet company said.
