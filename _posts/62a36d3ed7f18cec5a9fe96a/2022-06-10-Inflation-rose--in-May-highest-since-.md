The consumer price index for May was expected to increase 8.3% from a year ago, according to Dow Jones estimates.

## Highlights

- Consumer price index is up 8.6% from a year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981.
- Gasoline, food and shelter prices all contributed to the increase.
- Food prices rose another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.
- Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6%, even though average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in April.
- The inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices.
- The report likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest rate increases ahead of the Fed's rate hike.
