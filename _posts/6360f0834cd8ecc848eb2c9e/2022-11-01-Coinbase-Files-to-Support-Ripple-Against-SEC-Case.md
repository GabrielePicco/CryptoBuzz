The crypto exchange joins a trade group and other groups in arguing the SEC's case threatens the broader industry.

## Highlights

- The crypto exchange joins a trade group and other groups in arguing the SEC's case threatens the broader industry.
- "In addition, existing SEC registration requirements for national securities exchanges are currently unsuitable to the way digital asset platforms operate," the filing said.
- "Existing SEC requirements, however, only allow broker-dealers to be members of registered securities exchanges," the crypto exchange said in the filing.
- The filing says that retail customers can only trade assets on exchanges indirectly by using the services of broker-Dealers that charge transaction fees and add intermediation risks that could be avoided on digital asset trading platforms, again to the benefit of customers' benefit.
