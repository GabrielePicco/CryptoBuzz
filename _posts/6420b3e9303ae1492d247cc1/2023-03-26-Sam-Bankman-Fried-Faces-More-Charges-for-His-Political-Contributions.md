Sam Bankman-Fried made several political donations to democrat candidates, and it looks like those donations may have been illegal.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of FTX, has been charged with fraud.
- Four new criminal charges have been filed against him.
- Some of the charges stem from the political contributions he made to democrat candidates in the past.
- The contributions are believed to have been illicit because they were made using either company funds or through what’s called a straw fund, in which customer money was moved to a private account designed to influence the political environment.
- An unnamed political ethics firm has requested the Federal Election Commission to look into the case for ‘serious violations’ If convicted, he could face another 40 years in prison.
- The political candidates that accepted donations from SBF aren't walking away unaffected.
