Using a toilet can pay for your coffee or buy you bananas at a university in South Korea, where human waste is being used to help power a building.

## Highlights

- Using a toilet can pay for your coffee or buy you bananas at a university in South Korea, where human waste is being used to help power a building.
- An average person defecates about 500g a day, which can be converted to 50 litres of methane gas.
- Each person using the eco-friendly toilet earns 10 Ggool, which means honey in Korean.
- Students can use the currency to buy goods on campus, from freshly brewed coffee to instant cup noodles, fruits and books.
- The gas can generate 0.5kWh of electricity or be used to drive a car for about 1.2km (0.75 miles)
