A man who was allegedly kidnapped and had his teeth ripped out was abducted as he lay in bed beside his influencer girlfriend in her family's house.

## Highlights

- Peter Vuong, 26, and his girlfriend Angel Bowyer were sleeping in her family's Smithfield home when he was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint and taken to a squalid house 20km from home.
- Mr Vuong's face was covered for days and his teeth were 'forcibly removed' by members of the gang, police allege.
- He was allegedly held captive for six days in an abandoned house in Belmore, Sydney's west.
- Police say the gang demanded $5 million from high flying crypto trader Tran Dinh a relative of Ms Bowyer's high-flying property developer relative.
- Mr Dinh is a successful businessman and father whose partner regularly shares photos of his lavish life - including on holidays in Paris.
