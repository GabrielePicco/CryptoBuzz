You may have heard about the cryptojacking malware on macOS. Read about a new one spotted by Jamf Threat Labs.

## Highlights

- Malware is a stealthy and large-scale crypto-mining scheme that is becoming increasingly prevalent.
- Malware makes use of the Invisible Internet Project (i2p) for communication.
- i2p is a private network layer that anonymizes traffic, making it a less noticeable alternative to Tor.
- This malware uses i2P to download malicious components and send mined currency to the attacker's wallet.
- Since January 2023, a handful of vendors have detected the malware.
- However, many of the malicious applications continue to go unidentified by most vendors.
