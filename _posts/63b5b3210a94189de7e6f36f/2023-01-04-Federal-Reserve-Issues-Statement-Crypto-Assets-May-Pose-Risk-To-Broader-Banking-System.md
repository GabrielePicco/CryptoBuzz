The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint statement on Tuesday warning about the risks crypto poses to the banking system.

## Highlights

- Federal Reserve, FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint statement on Tuesday warning about "significant" risks crypto assets may pose to the banking system.
- Regulators are warning banks about a long laundry list of risks when it comes to crypto, including fraud, volatility, poor risk management, and contagion within the crypto sector.
- Tuesday's statement came just minutes before Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder and former CEO of failed crypto exchange FTX, pleaded not guilty on eight counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy, and faces up to 115 years in prison for his alleged role in the highest-profile crypto collapse.
