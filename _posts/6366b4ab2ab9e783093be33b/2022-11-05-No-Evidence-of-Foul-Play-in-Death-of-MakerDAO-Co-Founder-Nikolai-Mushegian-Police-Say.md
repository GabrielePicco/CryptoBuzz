A cause of death awaits an autopsy of Nikolai Mushegian, who tweeted hours before being found dead that he was the target of a murder plot.

## Highlights

- Nikolai Mushegian's body was found washed up on a beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico, last week.
- Police have found no signs of foul play in the 29-year-old's death, though he suffered a laceration to his skull.
- Hours before his death, the developer tweeted that mysterious forces, including the Mossad, the CIA and a “pedo ring” were planning to kill him.
- The tweet, predictably, fueled a number of simmering conspiracy theories.
- A source close to the investigation says it could be considered a suicide by the crypto-developer.
- The body of MakerDAO co-founder was found on Ashford Beach, an area well-known for its dangerous swimming conditions.
