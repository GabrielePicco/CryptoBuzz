It seems that the Twitter account of Kevin O'Leary, has been hacked by scammers who are pushing a crypto giveaway.

## Highlights

- Kevin O'Leary's Twitter account of 'Shark Tank' has been hacked by scammers pushing a giveaway of Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH.
- On December 29, the account pinned a tweet about a supposed giveaway and instructed followers to “click on the picture to join the event.” In a succession of tweets, the TV personality’s followers started to get suspicious due to the volume of tweets and the syntax used.
- O’Leary was paid $15 million by FTX to serve as a paid advocate for the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, which some people have referred to as fraudulent.
- FTX investors have filed a lawsuit against O‘Leary among other celebrities.
