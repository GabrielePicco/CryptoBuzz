\"Gutted right now,\" one customer of the once-$3 billion valuation lending firm said.

## Highlights

- BlockFi paused withdrawals after FTX announced it would buy the crypto lending firm.
- BlockFi once boasted a $3 billion valuation and secured backing from investors including Valar Ventures, Paradigm, SoFi, Galaxy Digital and Akuna Capital.
- One former employee told The Block that he feels "sick" and "crickets" from leadership and internal employees have heard nothing from BlockFi.
- With the FTX Group now in the process of seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, BlockFi's future is becoming increasingly cloudy.
- The company is still asking customers to park funds on the platform to top up collateral to get more money back on the site.
