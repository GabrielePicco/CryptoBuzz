- To fund the project, Pixelmon developers released a collection of 10,000 NFTs in February.
- The team raised over $70 million from the sale.
- But the project has been a laughing stock on social media since the reveal went poorly.
- At the time of writing, the floor price (the cheapest an NFT in the set is listed on the OpenSea marketplace) is.39 ether ($1,500) The team behind the project admitted that the project's creator of the Pixelmon project's Discord server, Syber, wrote "I'm not going to sugar coat it up"
