Ethereum is generating more and more revenue by renting its security to the steadily growing ecosystem of Layer 2 networks.

## Highlights

- Layer 2 networks are spending record amounts of gas on the mainnet of Ethereum mainnet.
- The highest amount of gas ever used to settle Layer 2 network transactions occurred this Wednesday.
- Layer 2 is an umbrella term for blockchain scaling solutions that handle transactions on separate networks then send them back to mainnet for settlement.
- Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal speculated that over time, the network might evolve from a user-focused to a network-focused chain where it primarily settles batched Layer 2 transactions instead of individual, user-generated mainnet transactions.
- This is because the base gas fees on ETH are burned, reducing the overall ETH supply and thus increasing the value of all remaining tokens.
