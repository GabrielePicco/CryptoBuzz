With the US authorities closing in on taxpaying obligations, here are three things to consider.

## Highlights

- The IRS is going after crypto owners who fail to report gains on their taxes.
- The government seized $3.5 billion in crypto last year alone.
- The US tax authority got a court order Thursday enjoining an NYC bank to turn over records on potential crypto tax dodgers.
- Here are three things to know about filing and paying US income taxes on cryptocurrency capital gains on the tax bill: FIFO, LIFO or HIFO methods to calculate capital gains or losses.
- There is no Section 1031 ‘like kind’ exemption for crypto.
- Trading BTC for ETH, for example, does not defer tax obligations on any capital gains.
