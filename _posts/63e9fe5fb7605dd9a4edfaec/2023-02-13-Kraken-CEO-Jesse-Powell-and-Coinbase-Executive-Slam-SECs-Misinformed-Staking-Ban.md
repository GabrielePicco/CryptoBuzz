## Highlights

- Kraken CEO Jesse Powell and Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal are vocally criticizing the U.S.
- Securities and Exchange's latest enforcement action against crypto staking.
- SEC chair Gary Gensler told CNBC in an interview that Kraken was not disclosing to the public the complete risks associated with staking their digital assets on the platform.
- Genslers said that Kraken “knew how to register” on the SEC website for the necessary regulatory requirements, but neglected to do so.
- In response, Powell implied that Gensel’ claim was untrue, saying, “Oh man, all I had to do was fill out a form on a website and tell people that staking rewards come from staking?”
