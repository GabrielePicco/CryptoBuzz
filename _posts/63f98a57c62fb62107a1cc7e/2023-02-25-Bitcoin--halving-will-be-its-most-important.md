Charles Edwards, founding father of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, says Bitcoin stands in the beginning of a “new regime” after its early 2023 value positive aspects, and subsequent 12 months will show pivotal

## Highlights

- Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, says Bitcoin is in the beginning of a “new regime” after its early 2023 value positive aspects.
- The jury should be out on whether or not the underside is in for BTC’s value, however for long-term buyers, the time to allocate is simply starting, he argues.
- Edwards: ‘We’ve got all of the indicators of a typical turning level on worth and sentiment.
- This isn’t to say I count on value to dramatically rally upward from right here prefer it did in January.
- My base case is a constructive 2023, with the extra vital cyclical development and returns coming in 2024’
