Lawyer John Deaton, amici curiae in the landmark SEC vs. Ripple case weighs in on Gary Gensler's ruling iron fist when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation.

## Highlights

- Gary Gensler, President Biden’s pick to run an agency intended to focus on stock scammers ripping off the unsuspecting, has dived headfirst into crypto like Eliot Ness going after Al Capone.
- If successful, almost 80 years of U.S.
- securities laws will be upended within two years as Chair of the SEC.
- Front line regulation of digital assets belongs to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – the main regulator of investments that are not deemed traditional securities.
- Since Howey, Congress has failed to pass any new legislation that would directly involve the regulation of crypto, the CFTC is the de facto regulator.
