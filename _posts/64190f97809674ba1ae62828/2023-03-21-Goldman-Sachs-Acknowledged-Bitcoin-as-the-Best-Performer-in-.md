## Highlights

- Bitcoin's price has soared from $16,500 on January 1 to approximately $28,400 at the moment of writing these lines (a 70% increase) Goldman Sachs said bitcoinâ€™s potential had outpaced that of traditional assets, precious metals, and other investments in terms of year-to-date (YTD) and risk-adjusted returns.
- BTC has outperformed IT stocks, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, gold, and many other investment instruments.
