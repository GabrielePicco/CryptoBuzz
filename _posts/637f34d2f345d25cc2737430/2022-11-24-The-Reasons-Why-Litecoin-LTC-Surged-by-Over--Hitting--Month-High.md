Litecoin decoupled and is currently showing signs of more gains ahead of its third halving event.

## Highlights

- Litecoin climbed to a high of $81 on November 23rd, recording a six-month high.
- At the beginning of the year, Litecoin was trading near $150.
- However, subsequent bearishness in the market prompted the crypto-asset to fall as low as $42 in June.
- The divergence from the market-wide slump comes eight months before the much-anticipated halving event that will slash Litecoinâ€™s pace of supply expansion by 50%.
- The third mining reward halving, slated for August 2023, rewards paid to LTC miners for recording transactions on the blockchain will be cut from the current 12.5 LTC per block to 6.25.
