Circle, the payments company behind the USDC stablecoin, has released a full asset breakdown of the reserves backing its dollar-pegged token.

## Highlights

- USDC is currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and second largest stablecoin in the crypto economy.
- Report shows that Circle held $42.1 billion in U.S.
- treasury bonds as of June 30.
- The remainder of the companyâ€™s reserves, $13.6 billion, are reportedly stored in cash and held with regulated financial institutions such as Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and others.
- Only Tether, the issuer behind the long-time king of stablecoins USDT, is yet to provide a similar detailed report on its reserve assets, according to its recent attestation numbers from late March.
