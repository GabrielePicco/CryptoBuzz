Comparison website Finder is back again with a new batch of tea leaves and predictions for Bitcoin's near and longer-term future.

## Highlights

- Finder's latest Bitcoin Price Prediction Report is released by Aussie-founded comparison website Finder.
- It asks 60 fintech, crypto and industry experts to give their views on Bitcoin's near and longer-term future.
- Finder's weekly survey pulls in opinions and predictions from a rotating panel of five experts, while its quarterly survey gathers a broader look at BTC from 55 other industry specialists.
- The Finder panel has landed on an averaged-out figure of US$15,283 at potentially some point before the end of the year.
- According to 77% of the panelists, Bitcoin is still a store of value, and thatâ€™s despite its decline of roughly 70% from its all-time-high set last November.
