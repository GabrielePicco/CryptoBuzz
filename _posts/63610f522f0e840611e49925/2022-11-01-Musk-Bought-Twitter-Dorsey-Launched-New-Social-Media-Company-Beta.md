Jack Dorsey's Bluesky Social received 30,000 sign-ups in two days for its beta-testing waitlist as Elon Musk's Twitter deal neared its close.

## Highlights

- Jack Dorsey's new social-media platform, Bluesky Social, is now accepting beta users.
- The news coincides with Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, which Dorsey founded and ran.
- Dorsey cofounded Twitter in 2006 and had several years-long stints as CEO, most recently from 2015 to 2021.
- The initial news drew 30,000 sign-ups in two days for the beta-testing waitlist, company representatives said.
- The platform is intended to support "a new foundation for social networking which gives creators independence from platforms, developers the freedom to build, and users a choice in their experience," the company said on its website.
