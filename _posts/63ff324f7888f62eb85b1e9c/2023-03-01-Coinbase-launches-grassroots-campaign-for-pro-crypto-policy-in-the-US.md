The U.S. has been criticized by the crypto industry for allegedly having vague laws that make it hard for the businesses to comply.

## Highlights

- #Crypto435 is a grassroots political campaign to promote pro-crypto policies.
- U.S.
- Congress has not passed any laws defining what a cryptocurrency is or legislating how specifically crypto businesses can comply with regulation.
- The issue of crypto regulation continues to be hotly debated both inside and outside the crypto community.
- Some XRP fans feel the move is hypocritical, saying it should have delisted XRP after it was labeled a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a security.
- However, the SEC Chair Gary Gensler has argued that existing laws that make it hard for businesses to comply with them apply to crypto businesses in some cases.
