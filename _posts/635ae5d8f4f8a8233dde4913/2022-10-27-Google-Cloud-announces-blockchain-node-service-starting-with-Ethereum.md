Google Cloud is launching a blockchain node-hosting engine.

## Highlights

- Google Cloud is opening up a blockchain node-hosting engine.
- The company says it will streamline the process of setting up a new node and hosting it on your own hardware.
- Google's first supported blockchain is Etherum, the company says.
- The service will be managed by a Google team that began assembling a web3-focused team earlier this year.
- Google began to natively support data for Etherum's wallet balances earlier this month, and is now natively supporting data for the Bitcoin currency's wallet balance.
