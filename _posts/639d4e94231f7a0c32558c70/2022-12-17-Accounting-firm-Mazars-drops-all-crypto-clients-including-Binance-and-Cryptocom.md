Binance and Crypto.com are among the crypto companies dropped by the accounting firm Mazars, sending shockwaves through a crypto community looking for more transparency.

## Highlights

- French accounting firm Mazars is pausing all its work with crypto firms including, Crypto.com, KuCoin, and Binance.
- Mazars' pullback from the crypto market comes as customers and investors seek greater transparency surrounding the crypto exchanges they use in the wake of the collapse of FTX.
- Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao spoke over Twitter Spaces, calling the moment a "stress test," though perhaps not offering the assurance investors needed.
- The exchange also temporarily halted withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC citing to daily banking hour constraints during a record period of withdrawals.
- However, against its ratio of reserves, the company has withstood larger waves of withdrawals in 2021 and 2020, according to CryptoQuant data.
