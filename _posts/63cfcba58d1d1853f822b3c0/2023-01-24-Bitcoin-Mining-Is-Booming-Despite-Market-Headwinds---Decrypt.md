While certain miners have dumped Bitcoin to inflate their balance sheets, or filed for bankruptcy, things aren't quite as bleak as they seem.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin mining has never been harder, according to the latest data from CoinWarz.
- The networkâ€™s mining difficulty hit a new all-time high of 37.59 trillion hashes after posting a rare increase of over 10% on January 15.
- Bitcoin's hash rate has also been steadily climbing over the last three years, despite briefly plunging after Terra collapsed in May 2021.
- This downturn, coupled with energy price inflation, means that mining margins have never been thinner for some miners.
- Decrypt spoke to some of the sector's leaders to get a sense of why it's still business as usual in the mining industry, despite sunken prices and widespread insolvencies.
