In the run-up to the Vasil hard fork upgrade, there has been a significant interest in Cardano from the crypto community.

## Highlights

- The Vasil hard fork upgrade has been touted as one of Cardano's necessary and important network updates that have been touted to improve the blockchainâ€™s performance and establish it as a formidable decentralized crypto project.
- The run-up to the upgrade has resulted in significant interest in Cardano from the crypto community.
- The increase in social mentions appears to have ignored any previous concerns regarding the Vasil upgrade's delayed rollout due to alleged software testing and bugs.
- However, despite the positive network development, signs of breaking out appear bleak, considering the prevailing bearish sentiments.
- In total, ADA has recorded 2.32 million social mentions, according to Lunar Crash data.
