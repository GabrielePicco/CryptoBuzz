The Only Crypto Drama News Site

## Highlights

- Bitcoin dropped below $36,000 for the first time since February.
- Argentina recently announced that they will ban new crypto activities in banks.
- Hedera Hashgraph set new 52-week lows, with many altcoins setting new lows.
- If Bitcoin can break past a resistance level at $38,000, there could be a rally to 40k or more.
- But if Bitcoin goes below a support at $35k, there may be a further drop to $30,000.
- In these times of war and sky-high inflation, the best strategy is taking profit/losses when you need too, but HODLing your safest assets while dollar cost averaging.
