Starbucks Brewing Revolutionary Web3 Experience for its Starbucks Rewards Members

## Highlights

- Starbucks Odyssey experience will offer members the ability to earn and buy digital collectible stamps (NFTs) that will unlock access to new, immersive coffee experiences.
- Starbucks is one of the first companies to integrate non-fungible tokens with an industry-leading loyalty program at scale, while creating a digital community that will enable new ways to engage with members and partners (employees) Starting Sept.
- 12, customers and partners can join the waitlist for a chance to be among the first to receive access to the experience, which will launch later this year.
- Starbucks Odyssey is powered by Web3 technology powered by Polygon, which uses less than energy than “work-of-work” blockchains.
