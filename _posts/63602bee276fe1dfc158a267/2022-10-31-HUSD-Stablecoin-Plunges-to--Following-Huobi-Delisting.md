HUSD has lost almost 70% of its valuation since Huobi stopped supporting trades for the token last week.

## Highlights

- Huobi’s native stablecoin – HUSD – lost its parity with the American dollar and tumbled by nearly 70% after the exchange delisted the asset last week.
- At one point, its valuation dropped to $0.28, the lowest level in its three-year existence.
- HUSD is a stablecoin that is pegged to the valuation of relatively non-volatile currencies like the US dollar and the euro or precious metals, including gold.
- Huobi will no longer support trades for HUSD and urged customers holding the asset to convert them into Tether (USDT) at a 1:1 ratio.
- The asset's collapse reminds of the crash of another token earlier this year – that of UST.
