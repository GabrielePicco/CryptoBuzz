Bitcoin mining difficulty has jumped by 9.26% over the last two weeks, possibly meaning less profits as more computing power is needed.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin mining difficulty has jumped by 9.26% over the last two weeks.
- The networkâ€™s mining difficulty is the highest that it has been since January.
- Bitcoin mining is the process of using powerful computers to verify transactions on the blockchain.
- Mining companies are usually large operations that utilize server farms and use a lot of energy, are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin.
- Last month, miners in Texas suspended operations to help the energy grid and conserve energy during a heatwave.
- They switched on again weeks later, and now as difficulty increases, miners could face slimmer profits as more computing power (and energy) is needed but the value of Bitcoin has remained stagnant.
