Helium had listed Salesforce and Lime about partners---they said they are not in partnership. All while Helium's revenue decline to $6.5k/month.

## Highlights

- Helium is a decentralized, user-powered wireless network that works as a mesh net competitor to typical internet providers.
- Salesforce and Lime, companies whose icons were listed under Heliumâ€™s active partners section, said they had no current relationships with Helium.
- CEO Amir Haleem put out a series of tweets explaining the shape some of these partnerships take which may have led Helium to misunderstand the current state of their relationships with these companies.
- Helium has raised $365M with top venture capital firm a16z as the lead investor, and an estimated $250M has been spent by retail investors on hotspot nodes.
- The average node makes about $20/month, and some users are reporting far lower earnings.
