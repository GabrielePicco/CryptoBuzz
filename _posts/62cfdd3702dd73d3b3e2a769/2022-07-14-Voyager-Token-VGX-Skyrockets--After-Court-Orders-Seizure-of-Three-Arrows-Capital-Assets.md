The native token of a popular cryptocurrency app is rallying despite several turbulent weeks involving lawsuits and even suspending trading on its platform.

## Highlights

- The native token of a popular cryptocurrency app is rallying despite several turbulent weeks involving lawsuits and even suspending trading on its platform.
- Over the past day, the VGX altcoin exploded from $0.15 to a peak of $1.03 for a 586% gain.
- Voyager Digital has issued a notice of default to hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) as well as filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
- Since Voyager halted trading on their platform, investors who hold VGX on the app canâ€™t actually sell or take advantage of the rally.
- VGX is still available to buy and sell on at least a dozen other crypto platforms, however.
