US sanctions, failing banks, and the drying up of foreign aid have left Afghanistan's economy in tatters.

## Highlights

- Afghanistan's economy is in tatters after US sanctions, failing banks, and drying up of foreign aid.
- Mr Hotak found temporary refuge in Pakistan, but is trading Bitcoin and Ethereum again.
- He is now teaching people about cryptocurrencies - digital money with no physical form that can have value - using Binance's P2P crypto exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform.
- He and his friends use the platform to trade their coins and sell them to each other on Bitcoin and Etherum, which can be traded with other people on other platforms in order to make sure they have a buyer and seller.
