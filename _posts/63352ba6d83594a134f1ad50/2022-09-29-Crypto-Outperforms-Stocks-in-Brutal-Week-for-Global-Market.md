Major cryptocurrencies are showing signs of strength despite a surging dollar wreaking havoc on global stock markets and major currencies this week.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies show signs of strength despite a surging dollar wreaking havoc on global stock markets and major currencies this week.
- The S&P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq have shed more than 4% each in the past seven days.
- Bitcoin, meanwhile, has eked out a 0.7% gain and Ether fell less than 2%.
- The disconnect is significant given how closely Bitcoin and Ether have tracked equities over the last several quarters.
- This correlation has prompted skeptics to dismiss Bitcoin as a haven from inflationary economies and their sovereign currencies.
- Market observers point at several factors that could be contributing to digital assetsâ€™ outperformance.
