A group of ConsenSys shareholders are demanding an audit of a deal that saw JPMorgan win significant stakes in Ethereum's Infura and MetaMask.

## Highlights

- A group of ConsenSys shareholders are demanding an audit of a deal that saw JPMorgan win a stake in two of the company's flagship products.
- The deal, known within CAG as Project North Star, resulted in financial institutions (JPMorgan) winning a significant slice in the company’s lucrative intellectual property (IP) A year after the transaction, the IP in question was used to raise funds for CSI at a valuation of $3 billion.
- After a current round, CSI is expected to hit $7 billion.
- Original CAG insiders reckon the deal was “to the detriment of the minority shareholders of CAG and to the benefit of Joseph Lubin personally”
