MARK ZUCKERBERG intends to reduce Meta's hiring and reorganize the company internally.

## Highlights

- Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to halt hiring and reduce spending across teams last week.
- Since the creation of Facebook in 2004, the company has never experienced budget cuts on this magnitude.
- Zuckerberg: “I had hoped the economy would have more clearly stabilized by now.
- However, based on what we can currently see, it doesn’t appear that it has, so we want to make some conservative plans,” he said.
- The price of Meta stock has dropped dramatically by about 60% since the year 2022 began.
