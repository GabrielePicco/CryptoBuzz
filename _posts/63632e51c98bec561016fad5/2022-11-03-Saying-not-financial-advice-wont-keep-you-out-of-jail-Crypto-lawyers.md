The popular disclaimer \"this is not financial advice\" is \"by an large pretty useless,\" digital asset lawyers to Cointelegraph.

## Highlights

- Digital asset lawyers say 'this is not financial advice' may not actually protect influencers in the eyes of the law.
- Lawyer Liam Hennessy said “advice warnings” are “by and large pretty useless,” while Australian digital lawyer Michael Bacina of Piper Alderman added that they aren’t “magic words” that when uttered will disclaim liability.
- Influencers should do their due diligence researching a crypto project before running a promotion, lawyers say.
- The best way for crypto influencers to protect themselves is to be able to determine “what token is a security and what token is not a security”
