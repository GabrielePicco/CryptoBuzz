Do Kwon has submitted a new fork proposal and recovery plan to the Terra community. His tweets after the crash have caused many negative reactions from the public. South Korean officials are actually investigating Kwon for fraud involving the anchor protocol.

## Highlights

- Do Kwon has submitted a new fork proposal and recovery plan to the Terra community.
- South Korean officials are investigating Kwon for fraud involving the anchor protocol.
- South Korea authorities are investigating whether the protocol's promised 20% interest on the UST stablecoin fits the definition of a Ponzi scheme.
- If found guilty, Kwon will likely be in the South Korea corrections system for a long period of time.
- Kwon is now being compared to famous frauds such as Bernie Madoff and faketoshi Craig Wright.
- His fall from grace is especially notable when you consider LUNA rivaling Bitcoin as a store of value, and it's nearly at zero.
