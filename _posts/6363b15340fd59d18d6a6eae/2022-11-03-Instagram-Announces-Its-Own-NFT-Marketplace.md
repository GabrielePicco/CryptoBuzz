Social media giant Instagram announced the launch of its own NFT marketplace, which will soon permit its users to mint and trade NFTs.

## Highlights

- Instagram, in collaboration with Polygon, has announced the launch of its own NFT marketplace.
- The marketplace will permit users to mint and sell their NFTs on the platform.
- Instagram will also be rolling out a new toolkit that will help users navigate its newly launched marketplace.
- “People can easily support their favourite creators by buying their digital collectibles directly within Instagram,” the announcement reiterated.
- The company recently published its Q2 earnings report, which disclosed a staggering loss of $3.7 billion, but Mark Zuckerberg seems positive that his company will soon bounce back considering its recent investments in the sectors of Instagram reels and AI.
