Developers can “do more innovation more quickly” on Bitcoin layer twos because the base layer doesn’t mix computation with settlement.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin isn’t programmable, but it’s an excellent settlement layer to build robust applications on top, says Hiro CEO Alex Miller.
- Miller said the value proposition behind building programs on top of Bitcoin is that it's a “really well settled, well accepted, very trustworthy settlement layer.” He said developers can “do more innovation more quickly” on a layer 2, which “has far, far more robust capabilities” Miller said that we’ll live in a ‘multi-chain future” without any particular smart contract platform ruling at all.
- He said that crypto volatility will decline when crypto applications become more “accepted, integrated, and used in our society,”
