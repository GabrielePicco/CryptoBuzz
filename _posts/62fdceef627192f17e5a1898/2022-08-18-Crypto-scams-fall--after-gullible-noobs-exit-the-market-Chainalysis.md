Crypto scammers have had their revenue slashed in 2022, while hackers have had a banner year exploiting vulnerable DeFi protocols, according to a Chainalysis report.

## Highlights

- The total total scam revenue year-to-date is currently sitting at $1.6 billion, equating to a 65% decline from the prior year period.
- The report was published Tuesday by Chainalysis, a leading research firm in the crypto crime report.
- The decline is due to falling asset prices and the exit of inexperienced crypto users from the market.
- Hackers have had a banner year exploiting vulnerable DeFi protocols, according to a Chainalysis report.
- Darknet market revenue is down 43% so far in 2022, due mainly to German law enforcement shutting down Russian darknet Hydra Marketplaceâ€™s servers on April 5, the report says.
