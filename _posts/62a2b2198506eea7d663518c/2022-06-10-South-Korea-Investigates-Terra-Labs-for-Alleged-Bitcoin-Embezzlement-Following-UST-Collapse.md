South Korean authorities are investigating, saying the implosion affected about 280,000 citizens.

## Highlights

- Terraform Labs held $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) in its reserves in a failed attempt to stabilize the price of UST.
- South Korean authorities estimate 280,000 of the country's citizens were affected by the collapse of luna, which is now known as luna classic (LUNC) Since the implosion of Terraform's stablecoin, the company released a new LUNA token that was airdropped to previous holders.
- Daniel Shin, a co-founder of the company, denied allegations of fraud, telling the Financial Times that there was "no intention of deception" and that the company wanted to innovate the payment settlement system using blockchain technology.
