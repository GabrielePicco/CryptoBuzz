## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX, which last week filed for bankruptcy.
- His mother, a Stanford law professor, once wrote an article titled "Beyond Blame" Barbara Fried argued that assigning "personal blame" in times of crisis had "ruined criminal justice and economic policy," suggesting it was "time to move past blame" The Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the SEC are said to be investigating FTX for potential mishandling of client funds.
- FTX's new CEO John Ray Ray Raynard gave a scathing assessment of the company's "complete failure of corporate controls" Raynard says he's scrambling to raise $8 billion to repay customers and creditors.
