There's a lot of hype around \"you have to get in now because you will be left behind otherwise,\" an official told the WSJ about Fidelity's bitcoin plan.

## Highlights

- Fidelity will let 401(k) savers put up to 20% of their savings into bitcoin.
- The Labor Department has "grave concerns" about the move, a Labor Department official told the WSJ.
- Bitcoin has fallen 40% since hitting a record high of about $69,000 in November.
- The Justice Department has warned that the volatile swings in crypto prices mean the digital assets are too risky for retirement savers.
- Fidelity is the first major retirement-plan provider to offer the option to invest in bitcoin in its 401(K) plans this year, a report says.
- The agency will talk to Fidelity about concerns in relation to that guidance, an official said.
