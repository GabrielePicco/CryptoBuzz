Coinbase has stated that it will pause deposit and withdrawal services for ETH and ERC-20 tokens during Ethereum's Merge event.

## Highlights

- The leading crypto exchange announced in a blog post today that it would “briefly pause” ETH and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals during the migration to Proof-of-Stake, which is scheduled to happen around September 15.
- The exchange indicated the measure was precautionary and trading services are expected to remain unaffected.
- Staked ETH and unstaked ETH balances will still be segregated; the exchange stated that staked ETH will not be available for unstaking until early 2023.
- The move is projected to greatly reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption and cut the ETH token emission rate by 90%.
- At the time of writing, the author of this piece owned ETH and several other cryptocurrencies.
