The troubled crypto lender paid down the remaining $41 million of a loan on the decentralized lending protocol Maker, prompting the release of $440 million collateral that had been held as collateral.

## Highlights

- Celsius Network halted all user withdrawals last month to avoid a run on deposits.
- The crypto lender paid down the remaining $41.2 million of a loan on the decentralized lending protocol Maker.
- That prompted the Maker protocol to release 21,962 wrapped bitcoins (WBTC), a bitcoin equivalent token of the Bitcoin blockchain, which was pledged as collateral of the loan.
- The move means a big liquidity boost for the beleaguered crypto lender's finances.
- Celsius halted all customer withdrawals and transactions on June 12 because of liquidity pressures, but the move is still down 81% since the start of the year.
- The native token of Celsius's platform, CEL, spiked 10% after repayment data became public.
