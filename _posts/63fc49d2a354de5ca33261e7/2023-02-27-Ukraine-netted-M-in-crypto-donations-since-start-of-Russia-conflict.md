Ukraine has received over $70 million in donations to help fund its military defense and provide humanitarian aid since the Russian invasion last February. Members of the Ukrainian government have praised cryptocurrencies for filling the void where the traditional banking system failed.

## Highlights

- Ukraine has received over $70 million in cryptocurrencies since the start of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
- The majority of the funds have come in the form of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) Donations have also come in nonfungible tokens, such as UkraineDAOâ€™s auction of a Ukrainian flag NFT for $6.1 million.
- Around 80% of the total $70m donated came in the first few months of the war, with the speed of payments fast-tracking the country's ability to respond to the Russian invasion.
- Pro-Russian military groups have also used cryptocurrency to crowdfund their war efforts, including using crypto donations to fund military purchases.
