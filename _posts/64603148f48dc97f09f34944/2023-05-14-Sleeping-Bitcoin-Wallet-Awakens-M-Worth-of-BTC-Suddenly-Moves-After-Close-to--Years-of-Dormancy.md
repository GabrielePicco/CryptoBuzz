On May 11, 2023, a long-inactive bitcoin wallet sprang to life and transferred a substantial 139.7 bitcoin worth $3.7 million.

## Highlights

- A dormant wallet created on June 19, 2011, suddenly relocated 139.7 BTC, equivalent to $3.7 million at the time of transfer, on May 11, 2023.
- The wallet still holds the funds and the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) associated with the wallet has not been spent.
- The address responsible for the transfer received a moderate privacy score of 45 out of 100 according to Blockchairâ€™s privacy-o-meter tool.
- It faces two issues: its entire balance was communicated to another address and multiple iterations of the same address appeared in inputs.
- These issues are not severe but they can be traced by monitoring applications examining linked transactions.
