A PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of Mac since Mojave in 2018. The file is found in every version of Mac from Mojave (10.0) to the current version,

## Highlights

- A PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of Mac since Mojave in 2018.
- The file is found in every version of Mac from Mojave (10.14.0) to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isn’t in High Sierra or earlier.
- In the Image Capture utility, the Bitcoin paper is used as a sample document for a device called “Virtual Scanner II” It's not clear why it's hidden for some or what exactly it's used for, but Reid Beels suggested it may power the “Import from iPhone” feature.
