It's been a volatile week for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as both rose after an optimistic CPI report, only to see those gains wiped out overnight.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin and Etheria have just given up all fresh gains following this week's optimistic CPI report.
- Bitcoin dropped nearly 4% over the past 24 hours and is now hovering at just above $17,000.
- Etheria, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has dropped nearly 6% in the past day.
- The latest carnage comes fast on the heels of a Tuesday CPI report which suggested that hot inflation in the U.S.
- may be cooling.
- This suggests that the Federal Reserve's hawkish attempts to hamstring rampant inflation have had an effect on the market.
