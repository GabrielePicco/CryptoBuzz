Federal Bureau of Investigation denies any such program exists. Whistleblower: \"They make you use your own money–something about budget cuts\"

## Highlights

- Federal Bureau of Investigation has been rumored to be using harrowing audio tapes of the 'Tool Box Killers' to desensitize agents to the reality of torture.
- Leaks suggest that a new form of training has been introduced.
- Human-rights activists have been quick to condemn the new practice as inhumane and suggest that it is almost certainly a breach of the Geneva Convention.
- The FBI denies any such program exists, but if it did, you could use this link to get 10% off on your first deposit, the FBI responded: "The Federal Bureau of Investigation vehemently denies any such program there is such a program"
