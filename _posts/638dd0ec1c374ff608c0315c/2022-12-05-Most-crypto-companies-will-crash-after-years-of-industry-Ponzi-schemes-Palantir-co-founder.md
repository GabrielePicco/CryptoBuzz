Crypto and Web3 have unrealized potential, but the lack of regulation over the years has led to speculative bubbles and Ponzi schemes, Joe Lonsdale says.

## Highlights

- Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir, says more crypto companies are going to fall to Ponzi scheme-style bankruptcy.
- FTX, a Bahamas-based crypto exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early November after reportedly losing at least $1 billion.
- BlockFi, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital also filed for bankruptcy last week.
- Despite recent turmoil in cryptocurrency markets, crypto-based technologies will continue developing more capabilities, the venture capitalist says.
- Some companies that have declared bankruptcy "have had a lot of corruption," he said, though he only named FTX.
- "Long term, there's a good part of crypto, but most of what we saw in crypto the last three, four, five years was a speculative bubble driven by cheap money"
