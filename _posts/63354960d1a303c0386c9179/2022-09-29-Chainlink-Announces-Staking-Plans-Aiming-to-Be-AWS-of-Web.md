At SmartCon 2022, Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov unveils plans to launch staking on the network in December.

## Highlights

- Chainlink announces two new programs designed to increase the economic sustainability of its services.
- The SCALE program will reduce the costs of putting oracle data and reports on-chain by splitting costs among a greater number of participants.
- The BUILD program will give early-stage projects priority access to services and advanced support in return for a contribution in their native token.
- Chainlink is rooted in a network of oracles, which take off-chain data and make it usable by blockchains and dapps.
- The startup is used by some of the most valuable DeFi apps, including Aave, Compound, dYdX, Synthetix, and Nexus Mutual.
