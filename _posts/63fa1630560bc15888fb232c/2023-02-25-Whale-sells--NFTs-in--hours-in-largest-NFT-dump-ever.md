The NFT whale in question, Machi Big Brother, dumped 90 BAYC NFTs, 191 MAYC NFTs and 308 Otherdeed NFTs — among others.

## Highlights

- Jeffrey Hwang, known colloquially as Machi Big Brother, dumped 1,010 NFT tokens for 11,680 Ether (ETH) or $18.6 million.
- Machi is reportedly one of the biggest receivers of the Blur (BLUR) token airdrop from upstart NFT marketplace Blur, which recently ousted OpenSea from being the top-ranked NFT platform in trading volume.
- Nansen’s simian psychometric enhancement technician, Andrew Thurman, theorized Machi could be a play to either book some profits while also conducting “one big wash trade to generate huge Blur profits” or a “pretty naked market manipulation”
