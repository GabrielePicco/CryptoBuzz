Whale Ahoy! A human smart enough to acquire 489.09 BTC in October 2010 is now moving their haul.... worth a cool $20 million.

## Highlights

- A dormant Bitcoin wallet containing 489,242,263 BTC has been reactivated after 11.4 years of inactivity.
- The wallet address in question is 17QBWJCGV4QbQhQhLbhcS7d9yB2S7DPLf4N9.
- At the end of October 2010, the market price of BTC was around $0.20.
- A few months later, its value soared to over $15,000.
- The minimum value of that 489.09 BTC never fell below $1000 again.
- This would justify their inactivity again, and then into almost $20 million.
