Experts and psychologists have identified a new and growing problem: crypto addiction. Multiple clinics have begun offering programs to help patients with this emerging illness. Like gambling, crypto addiction can also lead to compulsive behavior.

## Highlights

- More clinics are offering services to help crypto addiction.
- It's more volatile and exciting than gambling, says Castle Craig rehab therapist Anthony Marini.
- In many ways, crypto addiction shares many similarities with gambling addiction.
- In China, the last decade or so has seen a moral panic around internet addiction.
- Yet, policymakers and researchers have argued that individualsâ€™ definitions of addiction are not the same everywhere.
- When many of us trade in our own smartphones, it takes place in the context of our own homes or our own own homes, which are constructed entirely out of context.
