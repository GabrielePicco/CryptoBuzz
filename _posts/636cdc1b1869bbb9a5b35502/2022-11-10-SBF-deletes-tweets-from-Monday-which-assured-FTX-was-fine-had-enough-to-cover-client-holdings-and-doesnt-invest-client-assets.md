It's amazing that we would ever trust a kid that looks like this with all this money… Isn't that obvious? It used to be a businessman and suit, now it's some dude with unwashed hair and pajamas on

## Highlights

- It's amazing that we would ever trust a kid that looks like this with all this money… Isn't that obvious?
- It used to be a businessman and suit, now it's some dude with unwashed hair and pajamas on a video camera - heres all my money.
- It's not surprising we would trust this kid with all the money, it's a kid with no clean hair, no clean clothes, no pajama, no suit, no hair, and no clothes.
- It's an amazing thing that we're so proud of our kids, we're proud of their success, he's proud of them, he says.
