Considering 57% of its assets consist of stablecoins and less than 20% of BTC and ETH (compared to 67% at Coinbase), it begs a question: what role does Binance really play? And is it dangerous to the rest of the crypto market?

## Highlights

- Binance held US$69 billion worth of coins as of November 10, including 475,000 BTC, 4.8 million Ether and 58 million BNB coins.
- CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, said the figures reflect Binance’s own assets.
- He also rubbished Bloomberg's report that half of all tokens are, in fact, in Binance-issued coins.
- All of its customer holdings amount to only 8.5 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the entire cryptocurrency market, which stood at US$806 billion on November 10.
- The only other major non-fiat holding is Binance's “own” BNB — 58 million coins worth around one-third of all in circulation.
