The number of liquidations, especially liquidated shorts, have gone through the roof as BTC exploded by almost $2,000 in a day.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin retraced from last week’s high and stood around $21,000 after briefly dipping below that level.
- The number of liquidated traders on a daily scale is over 90,000, while the total value of liquidations is $400 million.
- The US central bank hiked the rates by 75 basis points and said it will continue to increase them throughout the year to fight inflation.
- The next FOMC meeting will be in late September, and the next is scheduled for November 25th – two months before the central bank's next rate hike is scheduled to be announced in September.
- Despite retracing slightly since that local peak, the primary cryptocurrency is still 9% up on the day.
