Shrimps purchasing Bitcoin over the past month have broken records for purchases of BTC. Whales too, are moving in for the kill.

## Highlights

- Shrimps purchasing Bitcoin over the past month have broken records for purchases of BTC.
- In total, more than 200,000 BTC were bought by these two groups of holders.
- The investment strategies going on right now shows some unity between shrimp and whale buying behavior in the bear market.
- Even if this month of June is the worst month in the history of BTC, shrimp and whales have sought to support the asset at all costs.
- Young investors are limiting their positions by expanding their exposure to Bitcoin during this crypto winter, while older investors have less risk appetites since they would have less to lose than older investors rather than lose money rather than risk it back.
