The crypto business run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are making the first ever job cuts for the crypto broker they started in 2014, Bloomberg reports.

## Highlights

- Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss announce 10% of jobs at their cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, Gemini Trust, would be eliminated.
- The layoffs were a part of assessing the business amid â€œturbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time, they said.
- The price of bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.76% has more than halved to around $30,000, a level the No.1 cryptocurrency has been struggling to hold on to.
- The cryptocurrency world has struggled amid falling prices across digital assets, notably the biggest one, notably bitcoin, which has been trading at $68,990.90 in November.
