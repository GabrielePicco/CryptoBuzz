According to a Reddit user's hypothesis, Bitcoin's value has lately risen owing to institutional actors influencing the market, including Binance CEO CZ.

## Highlights

- Reddit user believes Binance CEO CZ is manipulating the market.
- Binanceâ€™s market cap has fallen by millions per hour while its trading volume has increased.
- Reddit user claims that the SEC is going after Binance's stablecoin, BUSD, issued by Paxos.
- Since Binance holds a significant quantity of BUSD in its assets, this action has put the firm in a hazardous situation.
- The user concludes that although the surge might continue, investors should be wary of riding the wave of investor enthusiasm, as the current level of rigging may not be durable, as it's difficult to say what impact it will have in the long run.
