Looming macroeconomic concerns and this week’s $1B ETH options expiry threaten to pin Ethereum price under the $1,800 support.

## Highlights

- Ether's performance over the past three months has been less than satisfying for holders.
- The altcoin tested the $1,800 support for the first time since July 2021.
- The main victims of Ether’s 11% price correction were leverage traders (longs) who saw $160 million in aggregate liquidations at derivatives exchanges.
- A seven-block chain reorg on the Beacon Chain on May 25 created panic among Ether traders.
- A valid transaction sequence was knocked off the chain due to a competing block getting more support from the network participants.
- In a nutshell, macroeconomic data reflects risk-averse sentiment from investors and this partially explains Ether's downturn.
