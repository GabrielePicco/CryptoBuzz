As the crypto market grows exponentially, the Serbian Prince has expressed optimism that Middle Eastern monarchies might be open to it.

## Highlights

- According to him, most of these monarchies use the Sharia law that, among other things, entails a specific financial system that doesn’t recognize the concept of debt.
- Some of the countries that the Serbian Prince mentioned have previously shown interest in crypto.
- In mid-March, cryptocurrency exchange Binance was granted a Virtual Asset License allowing it to do business in Dubai.
- In late April, another crypto exchange – Kraken – received permission to establish a regulated crypto trading platform in the UAE, with regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi.
