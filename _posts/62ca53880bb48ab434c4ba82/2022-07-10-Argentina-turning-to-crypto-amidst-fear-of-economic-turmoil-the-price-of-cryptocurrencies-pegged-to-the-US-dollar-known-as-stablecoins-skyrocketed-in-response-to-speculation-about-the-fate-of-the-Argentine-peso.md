But eager speculators overpaid for stablecoins, as the peso failed to crash as they’d expected.

## Highlights

- Argentina's minister of the economy resigned over the weekend.
- Stablecoins, pegged to the U.S.
- dollar, were the first asset to reflect how the political upset would impact the economy.
- Some traders looked to beat what they expected to be a Monday morning devaluation by changing their pesos to “dólar cripto,” as stablecoins are locally known.
- For over 24 hours, between Saturday afternoon and Sunday night, some users overpaid for stablecoins in pesos.
- The value of a black market dollar settled at around 250 pesos on Wednesday, far from the crash some exchanges had speculated on Sunday morning.
