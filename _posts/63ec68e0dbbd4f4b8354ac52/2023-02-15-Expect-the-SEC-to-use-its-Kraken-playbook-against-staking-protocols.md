Some observers have suggested the SEC’s action against Kraken will push users toward DeFi protocols. The reality is that the SEC is coming for those as well.

## Highlights

- The SEC settled with Kraken on Feb.
- 9 for an action taken against the exchange’s staking rewards program.
- Kraken paid a $30 million fine and agreed to halt the program.
- The SEC will eventually apply its playbook to more decentralized staking protocols if the founders aren’t sufficiently anonymous.
- Some on Twitter were quick to comment that this is actually great news for crypto.
- But not so fast.
