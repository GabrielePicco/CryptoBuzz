The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index goes into extreme fear territory not seen since the COVID-19 crash as BTC marked its longest weekly bearish streak.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin made history in a rather negative week as this is the first time it closed in the red for seven consecutive weeks.
- Worst trading day came on May 12, when BTC slumped from just over $30,000 to its lowest price position since late December 2020 at $25,300.
- The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index goes into extreme fear territory not seen since the COVID-19 crash.
- Despite recovering to above 10 as of now, the metric is still well within fear levels.
- However, itâ€™s worth noting that bitcoin tends to react well in such times of apparent despair, though, the cryptocurrency not only recovered but went on to register new heights before ultimately charting a new ATH by the end of the year.
