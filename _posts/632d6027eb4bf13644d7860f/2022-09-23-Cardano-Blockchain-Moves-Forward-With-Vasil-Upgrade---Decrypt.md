The upgrade to the popular smart contract platform will retain all data, but will bring accelerated transaction times.

## Highlights

- The Cardano Vasil hard fork process begins today, and the Cardano Foundation says it will improve network performance.
- A hard fork occurs when a network's code fundamentally changes and requires the creation of a new and separate version of a blockchain.
- The upgrade to the popular smart contract platform will retain all data, but will bring accelerated transaction times.
- It's an important development for Cardano DeFi projects like Indigo Protocol, which has been running its synthetic assets project on the Vasil testnet since July.
- It will be possible to write Cardano smart contracts with less code, which makes lower transaction fees possible because more of them can fit into each block.
