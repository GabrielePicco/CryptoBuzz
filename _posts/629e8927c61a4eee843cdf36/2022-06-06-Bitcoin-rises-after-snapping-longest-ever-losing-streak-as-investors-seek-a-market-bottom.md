Bitcoin rose over the weekend as cryptocurrency investors continue to look for a bottom following a rough two months of selling.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin rose over the weekend as cryptocurrency investors continue to look for a bottom following a rough six months of selling.
- The largest cryptocurrency by market cap rose 4.3% Monday to $31,278.09.
- Ether advanced nearly 2% to $1,852.64; all three of the major stock averages were higher on Monday.
- Investors have been holding their breath while watching prices across risk assets move higher, uncertain if the moves are temporary or if a more permanent reversal is finally here.
- Some still say it's too early, however, and that bitcoin may have a short-lived gain but is more likely going to resume the downward trend we've seen for the past two months.
