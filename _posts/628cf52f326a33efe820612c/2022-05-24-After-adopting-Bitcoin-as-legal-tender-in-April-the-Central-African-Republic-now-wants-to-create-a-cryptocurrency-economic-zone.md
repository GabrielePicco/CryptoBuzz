After adopting bitcoin as legal tender, the Central African Republic now wants to create a cryptocurrency economic zone – Sango.

## Highlights

- Central African Republic is developing a hub to attract cryptocurrency businesses and enthusiasts to the nation.
- The initiative, coined Sango, was started by the CAR National Assembly with support by President Faustin-Archange Touadéra.
- Sango aims to take “the Bitcoin legacy to the next level” and institute a “cryptocurrency economic zone” in the Sango Island – where users will be able to propose, view and contribute to its future developments.
- CAR last month became the second country in the world to adopt bitcoin as a legal currency after El Salvador pioneered in the global scene with its Bitcoin Law in September 2021.
