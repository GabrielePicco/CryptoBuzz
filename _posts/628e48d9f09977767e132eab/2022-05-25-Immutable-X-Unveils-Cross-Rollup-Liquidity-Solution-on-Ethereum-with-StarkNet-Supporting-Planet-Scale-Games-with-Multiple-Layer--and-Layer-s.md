/PRNewswire/ -- Immutable X, which is powering the next generation of web3 games as the leading carbon-neutral, scalable platform for trading NFTs on Ethereum,...

## Highlights

- Immutable X will lead the charge in offering L3s to games with more than 10 million active users.
- With StarkNet, developers will be able to deploy custom, composable smart contracts, making it easy for projects to migrate L1 smart-contract based games to Immutable instantly.
- Immutable's mission is to ensure developers don't have to choose between security/liquidity and the UX of their game.
- The integration of StarkNet as a new settlement environment removes many previous developer tradeoffs, including the lack of custom smart contracts and complex migration from Layer 1 to Layer 2, and composability.
- However, it will be a less performant and UX-optimized environment.
