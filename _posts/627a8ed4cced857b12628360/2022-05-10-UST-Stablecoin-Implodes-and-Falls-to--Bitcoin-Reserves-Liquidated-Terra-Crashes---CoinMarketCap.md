Binance suspended withdrawals for both LUNA and UST in the early hours of Tuesday \"due to a high volume of pending transactions.\"

## Highlights

- Binance suspended withdrawals for both LUNA and UST in the early hours of Tuesday "due to a high volume of pending transactions" The TerraUSD stablecoin has lost its $1 peg and plunged to lows of $0.68 on Tuesday morning.
- UST now has a bigger market cap than LUNA, plunging to #13 at the time of writing.
- Terra's co-founder had attempted to calm traders by announcing that the Luna Foundation Guard was deploying $1.5 billion in capital to "allay market concerns" in the stablecoin.
- The LFG has emptied out its Bitcoin wallet as it battles to bring UST back to $1 â€” but there's now a bigger problem on the horizon.
