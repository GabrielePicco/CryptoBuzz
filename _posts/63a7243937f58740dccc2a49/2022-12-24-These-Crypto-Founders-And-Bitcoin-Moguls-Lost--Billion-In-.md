The embattled cryptocurrency industry and its wealthy pioneers face a moment of reckoning after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and hedge fund Alameda Research.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency and an industry bellwether, is down 65% from its $69,000 peak in November 2021.
- Some $2 trillion of market value has fled digital assets for safer pastures.
- 17 of cryptoâ€™s wealthiest investors and founders have collectively lost an estimated $116 billion in personal wealth since March.
- The man with the most to lose is Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, whose 70% stake in Binance is worth $4.5 billion.
- Binance could face clawback in bankruptcy court of the over $2.1 billion that Binance made from selling its stake in FTX back to Bankman-Fried in 2021.
