Wright’s attorneys say his scholarly work, personal history and, above all, his success convincing Gavin Andresen that he held Satoshi’s private keys are proof enough.

## Highlights

- Satoshi means “Ash” in Japanese – and Wright chose it because he wanted Bitcoin to “rise like a phoenix from its ashes.
- It had the added benefit of being the Japanese-language name of Pokemon character Ash Ketchum.
- Wright’s attorneys say his scholarly work, personal history and, above all, his success convincing Gavin Andresen that he held Satoshi's private keys are proof enough.
- Satoshi has several meanings, depending on the kanji used, none of which translate to ‘Ash’ or ‘Wisdom” or “wisdom’, according to gaming website CBR.
