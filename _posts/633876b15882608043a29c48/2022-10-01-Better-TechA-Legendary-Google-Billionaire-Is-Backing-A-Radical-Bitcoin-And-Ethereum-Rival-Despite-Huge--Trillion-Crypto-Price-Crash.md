Former Google chief executive and billionaire Eric Schmidt has said chainlink has \"better technology\" and \"scales better\" than other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum...

## Highlights

- Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt has said chainlink has "better technology" and "scales better" than other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.
- Schmidt joined Chainlink Labs as a strategic advisor in December last year.
- Chainlink's link cryptocurrency has crashed by more than 80% since hitting an all-time high in May last year, outpacing price declines seen by bitcoin, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies.
- Schmidt warned that looming crypto regulation could be coming prematurely, which some fear could stifle the industry and crypto innovation.
- The idea a blockchain-based, decentralized internet will eventually replace the Silicon Valley-centric web 2.0 that's dominated by Google and Facebook's Meta is "not normal"
