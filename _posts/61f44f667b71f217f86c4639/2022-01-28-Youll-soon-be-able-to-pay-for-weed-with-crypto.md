Cannabis is still highly regulated, and it's illegal federally, despite legalization and acceptance of adult-use weed across the country. Some dispensaries are already ahead of the curve and accepting crypto payments. The benefits of accepting crypto far outweigh any drawbacks

## Highlights

- Cannabis is still highly regulated, and it's illegal federally, despite legalization and acceptance of adult-use weed across the country.
- The SAFE Banking Act recently fizzled in Congressâ€”federal help is out of the question.
- In many legal states, the number of dispensaries is multiplying, but the feds still won't legalize it.
- Enter crypto for weed, which had a huge year in 2021 and will ultimately become widely accepted in the cannabis industry.
- The benefits of accepting crypto far outweigh any drawbacks, and not just because of the federal banking loophole and security issues, but some dispensaries are already ahead of the curve and accepting crypto payments online.
