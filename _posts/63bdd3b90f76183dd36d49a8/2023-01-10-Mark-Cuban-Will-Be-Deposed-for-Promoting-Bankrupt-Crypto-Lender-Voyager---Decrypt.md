Investors are not happy about Mark Cuban's marketing of Voyager, a crypto lender that went bankrupt shortly after Terra's collapse.

## Highlights

- Mark Cuban will be deposed in court next month as part of ongoing lawsuit against him by disgruntled customers of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager.
- The suit alleges Cuban misrepresented the firm in promotional materials.
- Cuban's full deposition will be held in one session on February 2 this year.
- Two Dallas Mavericks employees and three plaintiffs will deliver their depositions later this month.
- Voyager went bankrupt shortly after Terra collapsed in July last year, and Binance.US won the bid to scoop up Voyager’s remaining assets for $1.4 billion.
- The deal fell through after FTX.US collapsed a fortnight later, and Voyager.US emerged as ‘the best and highest bid” at just over $1 billion
