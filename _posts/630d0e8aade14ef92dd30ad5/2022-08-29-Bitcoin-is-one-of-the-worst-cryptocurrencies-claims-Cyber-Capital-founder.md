In light of Ethereum and Cardano technical upgrades, Cyber Capital founder said Bitcoin may get left behind, calling it out as being “purely speculative.”

## Highlights

- Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons has called Bitcoin (BTC) “technically one of the worst cryptocurrencies,” and a “purely speculative asset without utility” in comparison with other cryptocurrencies due to its lack of technological progress.
- Bons added that Bitcoin’s value proposition has long deteriorated due to a broken long-term security model, comparatively weak economic qualities and lack of capacity, programmability and composability.
- The founder of Cyber Capital has run nodes on the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks.
- He doesn’t appear to address the Bitcoin Lightning network, which is one of more obvious solutions to the network's scaling problem.
