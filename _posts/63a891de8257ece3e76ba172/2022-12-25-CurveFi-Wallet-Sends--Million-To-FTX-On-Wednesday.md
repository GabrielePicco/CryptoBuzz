The recipient FTX address then re-passed the money to Binance wallets and finally sent it to a cold wallet. Currently, the wallet holds...

## Highlights

- FTX received nearly $40 million in ETH in a single day in a transaction between Curve.Fi and FTX exchanges.
- The money was sent to the FTX wallet on Wednesday, December 22.
- The recipient FTX address then re-passed the money to Binance wallets and finally sent it to a cold wallet.
- The former CEO of the company Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing fraud charges from the United States government.
- No one knows who is responsible for this transaction, or why the money passed through several exchanges before finally reaching a cold.
- However, the anonymous investor was likely trying to take his money off of in-danger exchanges as soon as possible.
