The meme coin’s most prominent backer said he had earmarked 500 billion crypto tokens for the former POTUS, who replied that it “sounds good to me!”

## Highlights

- Donald Trump is seemingly now in the cryptocurrency game after he was gifted 500 billion “Let’s Go [Brandon]” tokens by a blundering Trumpworld investor.
- The gift was made by the coin's most vocal backer, hedge funder and diehard Trump supporter James Koutoulas, which he presented via a podcast hosted by D-list Trumpworld personality David J. Harris.
- It's not yet clear whether he has actually taken ownership of the tokens.
- The coin's value has fallen nearly 19 percent between noon Wednesday and early Friday afternoon, now down to $45,000.
- The original version of the coin took its inspiration from the slogan "Let's Go Brandon"
