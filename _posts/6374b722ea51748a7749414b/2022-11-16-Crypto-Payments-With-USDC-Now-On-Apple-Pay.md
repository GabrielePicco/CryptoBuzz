USDC issuer adds support for Apple Pay

## Highlights

- USDC added support for Apple Pay to help to boost the use of the coin by allowing users to make payments via Appleâ€™s Safari browser or in apps using iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and other supported devices.
- The move is expected to help build the future of commerce by boosting payments by making it easier and faster to make sure everyone can pay for their services.
- It should benefit businesses such as NFT marketplaces, crypto gaming, crypto exchanges, and cross-border remittance providers.
- The USDC appears to be an example of how the market is changing following the recent crash of the FTSE market, which crashed in the U.S.
