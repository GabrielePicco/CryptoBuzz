Labrys CEO Lachlan Feeney raised concerns of “hard-censorship” on Ethereum — a worst-case scenario where sanctioned transactions would be prevented from entering the blockchain.

## Highlights

- Labrys CEO Lachlan Feeney says 45% of all validator blocks currently run MEV-boost relay flashbots.
- MeV-Boost relays allow validators to outsource block production and sell the right to build a block to the highest bidder.
- Labrys released an MEV Watch tool on Sept.
- 28, which can inform validators about which MEV relays comply with OFAC sanctions.
- MEV – Flashbots - are centralized entities dedicated to efficient Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) extraction.
- The MEV - Flashbots are the most popular, with no Tornado Cash transactions in any of the 19,436 blocks verified by the Flashbots.
