Tether says the $10 billion withdrawal proved that the company is the most resilient in crypto and in traditional finance.

## Highlights

- Crypto traders withdrew around $10 billion from Tether USDT in the last two weeks.
- The massive withdrawal was fueled by Terra blockchain UST and LUNA collapse.
- Following USTâ€™s crash, USDT, alongside several stablecoins, temporarily lost its peg.
- Tether had earlier claimed that USDT has a one-to-one dollar backing in a bank account but later changed its tune to say it uses other assets such as commercial paper and even digital tokens as collateral.
- The firm must publish its reserves every quarter as part of the settlement.
- But some of its investments are performing poorly due to the bearish nature of the crypto market.
