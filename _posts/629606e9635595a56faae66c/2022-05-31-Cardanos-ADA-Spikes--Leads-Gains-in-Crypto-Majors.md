Bitcoin showed signs of bottoming out earlier this week, with the broader market adding some 4.4% in the past 24 hours.

## Highlights

- ADA showed signs of bottoming out earlier this week, with the broader market adding 4.4% in the past 24 hours.
- Price-charts suggest ADA saw support at the 45 cents level.
- However, the token could see strong resistance at the 80 cents mark.
- Readings on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a tool used by traders to calculate the magnitude of an asset’s price move – fell to nearly 33 earlier in the week, which suggested early signs of ADA bottoming.
