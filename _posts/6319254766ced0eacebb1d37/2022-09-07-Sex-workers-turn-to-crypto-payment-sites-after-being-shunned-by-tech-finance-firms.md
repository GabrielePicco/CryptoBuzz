## Highlights

- Adult content creators are turning to crypto-payment sites after mainstream financial and tech firms have moved to cut them off from cash payments.
- Wells Fargo recently sent out notices to several prominent sex workers informing them their accounts would be terminated.
- The move comes as Visa suspended payments for ads for ads on Pornhub and MindGeek after a lawsuit filed by a woman who says a sex tape that was filmed without her consent when she was 13 was posted on the site.
- An adult performer who left her $84,000-a-year job to start an OnlyFans account in March said the move gives her peace of mind that she will be paid.
