Do Kwon has urged holders of LUNA to “stay strong,\" as the price moves ever closer to zero. Prices are currently down 90% since yesterday.

## Highlights

- LUNA/USD is trading at $5.45, down 90% from yesterday's peak of $34.28.
- UST also fell to a new low of $0.2998 earlier today.
- LUNA founder Do Kwon has urged holders of LUNA to “stay strong” as the price moves ever closer to zero.
- The UST stablecoin lost parity with the dollar last night and is now trading at a bottom of $0.9486.
- Kwon is said to be working on a “recovery plan” for the LUNA and UST to recover from this crisis.
- It is yet to be seen if UST will survive long enough to be a part of any future developments.
