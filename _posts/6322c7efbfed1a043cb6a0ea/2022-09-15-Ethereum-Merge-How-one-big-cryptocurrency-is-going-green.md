Ethereum, which currently uses as much energy as a medium-sized country, is to halt cryptomining.

## Highlights

- "There are nerves in the sense that things will probably not go 100% smoothly, but that's expected," says researcher Justin Drake.
- "We have infrastructure in place that allows us to still move forward even if some parts of the network go down for some reason," he says.
- "It's really exciting and a major achievement," says Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation.
- The network currently uses as much energy as a medium-sized country, and is to halt cryptomining for the first time in the U.S.
