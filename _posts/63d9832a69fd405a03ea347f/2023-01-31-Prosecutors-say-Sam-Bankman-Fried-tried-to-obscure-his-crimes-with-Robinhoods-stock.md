Prosecutors say FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's efforts to control about $500 million worth of Robinhood shares last year indicates steps he has taken to \"obscure\" his alleged crimes. Prosecutors have since seized the stock

## Highlights

- Prosecutors say FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's efforts to control about $500 million worth of Robinhood shares last year indicates steps he's taken to "obscure" his alleged crimes.
- Prosecutors have since seized the stock and other assets totaling more than $700 million.
- The new allegation comes as prosecutors and lawyers have been going back and forth over the terms of his bail.
- The judge paused his ruling until February 7 to allow time for time for the appeal given the "novel" legal issue in the case in which he's accused of stealing billions of dollars from FTX customers in what prosecutors have described as one of the largest financial frauds in US history.
