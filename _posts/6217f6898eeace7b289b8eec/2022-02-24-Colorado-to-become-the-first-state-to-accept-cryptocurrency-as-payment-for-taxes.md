Colorado is set to become the first state to accept cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes and fees

## Highlights

- Colorado will become first state to accept cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes and fees.
- Governor Jared Polis said the state will take the digital coin payments and deposit the equivalent value in dollars into the stateâ€™s treasury.
- Polis has long been a vanguard in the intersecting world of cryptocurrency and politics.
- Other states, including Arizona and California, are proposing laws that would accept digital currency for tax purposes, not just for tax.
- El Salvador has been on a similar path for the better part of nine months, with Bitcoin seeing gains of more than 300% between March and December 2020, only to drop 45% from an all-time high in November 2021.
