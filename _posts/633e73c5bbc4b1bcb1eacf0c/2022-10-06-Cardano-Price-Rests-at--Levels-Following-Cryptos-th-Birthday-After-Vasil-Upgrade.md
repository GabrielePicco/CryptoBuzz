Cardano, the so-called “third-generation blockchain,” has been a first-class loser when it comes to price this far into the 2022 bear market.

## Highlights

- Cardano, the so-called “third-generation blockchain,” has been a first-class loser when it comes to price this far into the 2022 bear market.
- The perennial top-10 crypto, which briefly reached as high as the number 3 spot behind ether and bitcoin, has fallen about 86% from its September 2021 peak of just over $3 per coin.
- The chain’s total value locked (TVL) has similarly slid 77% from a March 2022 peak, and now stands at roughly $76 million, good for the 27th by that metric.
- Its decentralized applications (dapps) have also struggled to compete with other layer-1s.
