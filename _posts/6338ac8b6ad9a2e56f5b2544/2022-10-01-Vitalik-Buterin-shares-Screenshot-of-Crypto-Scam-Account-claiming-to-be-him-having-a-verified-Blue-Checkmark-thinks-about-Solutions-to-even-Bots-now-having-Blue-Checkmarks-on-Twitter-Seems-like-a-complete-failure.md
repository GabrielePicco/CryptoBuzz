Twitter's blue checkmarks are a complete failure in their current form. I'm definitely seeing the wisdom of turning twitter into an open API and letting third parties try to solve these problems.

## Highlights

- Twitter Web App will be open to third parties to try and solve problems.
- Seems like a complete failure of blue checkmarks in their current form.
- I'm definitely seeing the wisdom of turning twitter into an open API and letting third parties try to make the best UIs to solve these problems.
- Oct 1, 2022 · 6:20 PM UTC · Twitter Web app    -  Twitter Web App is now open to anyone who wants to use it as a tool for developing a web site with no easy way to get it to work with Twitter users and making it easier to use the blue checkmark for fraudulent accounts.
