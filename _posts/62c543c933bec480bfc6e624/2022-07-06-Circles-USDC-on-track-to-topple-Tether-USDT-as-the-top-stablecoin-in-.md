The USDT-to-USDC market cap ratio fell to its lowest ever in July 2022.

## Highlights

- Circle's native stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) reached its highest level of $55.9 billion on July 2.
- USDC's market capitalization has grown by 8.27% since May compared to rival Tether (USDT) in the last two months.
- This is the closest USDC has come to challenging Tether's supremacy in the stablecoin sector based on the diminishing gap between their market caps.
- In July, the USDT to USDC market cap ratio dropped to 1.20, the lowest on record, as shown in the chart below.
- USDT has a history of going below or above its $1-peg during extreme market volatility, though this was more pronounced in its earlier days.
