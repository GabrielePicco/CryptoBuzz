The formal upgrade, which will allow users to withdraw staked ETH, remains on track for a March delivery.

## Highlights

- The first mainnet shadow fork test of ETH withdrawal launched Monday.
- The test previewed the upcoming and much-anticipated Shanghai upgrade, which will introduce staked ETH withdrawals to the ecosystem.
- The formal upgrade remains on track for a March delivery.
- Users have staked almost $26.5 billion worth of ETH since December 2020 to earn rewards.
- The upgrade’s release will undoubtedly have a significant impact on crypto markets.
- Analysts at JP Morgan recently wrote that the ability for ETH stakers to withdraw funds “could usher in a new era of staking” for major crypto exchange, which has hemorrhaged value since the onset of the latest crypto winter last May.
