Bitcoin rises above $21,000

## Highlights

- Bitcoin prices bounce back to $21,500 after falling as low as $18,540 on the weekend.
- Market is sniffing out an imminent backstop for US bank deposits.
- The latest is a Washington Post article saying the US is weighing protecting all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank.
- Circle says it's on the hook for $3.3 billion deposits at the bank and (thankfully) moved out $5.4 billion before it was shuttered.
- The company put out a reassuring statement that's helped bring the stablecoin back to 96-cents.
- Still, it will need to get back to par on Monday or more trouble could emerge.
